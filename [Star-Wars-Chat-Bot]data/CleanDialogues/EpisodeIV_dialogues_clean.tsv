ANAKIN	you am a part of the rebel alliance   and a traitor  take her away

ANAKIN	i have traced the rebel spies to her  now she is my only link to find their secret base
COMMANDER	she have die before sheÕll tell you anything
ANAKIN	leave that to me  send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed
SECOND OFFICER	lord vader the battle station plans are not aboard this ship and no transmissions were made an escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting but no life forms were aboard
ANAKIN	she must have hidden the plans in the escape pod  send a detachment down to retrieve them  see to it personally commander  there have be no one to stop us this time

LUKE	  so i cut off my power shut down the afterburners and came in low on deak will trail  i was so close i thought i was going to fry my instruments as it was i busted up the skyhopper pretty bad  uncle owen was pretty upset  he grounded me for the rest of the season  you should have been there  it was fantastic
BIGGS	you ought to take it a little easy luke  you may be the hottest bushpilot this side of mos eisley but those little skyhoppers are dangerous  keep it up and one day whammo you am going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall
LUKE	look who will talking  now that you are been around those giant starships you am beginning to sound like my uncle you are gotten soft in the city 
BIGGS	i are missed you kid
LUKE	well things havecan not been the same since you left biggs  it will been so quiet
BIGGS	luke i didcan not come back just to say goodbye   i shouldcan not tell you this but you am the only one i can trust  and if i docan not come back i want somebody to know
LUKE	what are you talking about
BIGGS	i made some friends at the academy   when our frigate goes to one of the central systems we am going to jump ship and join the alliance 
LUKE	join the rebellion  are you kidding  how
BIGGS	quiet down will ya  you got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater
LUKE	ilet us sorry  ilet us quiet listen how quiet i am  you can barely hear me 
BIGGS	my friend has a friend on bestine who might help us make contact

BIGGS	i know it will a long shot but if i docan not find them i have do what i can on my own   it will what we always talked about  luke ilet us not going to wait for the empire to draft me into service  the rebellion is spreading and i want to be on the right side  the side i believe in
LUKE	and ilet us stuck here 
BIGGS	i thought you were going to the academy next term  you have get your chance to get off this rock
LUKE	not likely  i had to cancel my application  there has been a lot of unrest among the sand people since you left  they are even raided the outskirts of anchorhead
BIGGS	your uncle could hold off a whole colony of sand people with one blaster
LUKE	i know but he will got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off  he needs me for just one more season i  had leave him now
BIGGS	i feel for you luke you am going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important what good is all your uncle will work if it will taken over by the empire   you know they am starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems  it will not be long before your uncle is merely a tenant slaving for the greater glory of the empire
LUKE	it couldcan not happen here  you said it yourself  the empire will not bother with this rock
BIGGS	things always change
LUKE	i wish i was going   are you going to be around long
BIGGS	no ilet us leaving in the morning

LUKE	it looks like we docan not have much of a choice but i have remind him
OWEN	i have no need for a protocol droid
C-3PO	sir  not in an environment such as this  that will why i are also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that 
OWEN	what i really need is a droid that understands the binary languages of moisture vaporators
C-3PO	vaporators  sir  my first job was programming binary load lifters   very similar to your vaporators you could say 
OWEN	do you speak bocce
C-3PO	of course i can sir  it will like a second language for me   ilet us as fluent in bocce 
OWEN	all right shut up i have take this one
C-3PO	shutting up sir
OWEN	luke take these two over to the garage will you  i want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner
LUKE	but i was going into toshi station to pick up some power converters 
OWEN	you can waste time with your friends when your chores are done  now come on get to it
LUKE	all right come on  and the red one come on  well come on red would not go uncle owen 
OWEN	yeah

LUKE	yeah take it away
C-3PO	uh ilet us quite sure you have be very pleased with that one sir  he really is in firstclass condition i are worked with him before  here he comes
LUKE	okay would not go
C-3PO	now docan not forget this  why i should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity
===	===
C-3PO	thank the maker  this oil bath is going to feel so good  i are got such a bad case of dust contamination i can barely move
LUKE	it just iscan not fair  oh biggs is right  ilet us never gonna get out of here
C-3PO	is there anything i might do to help
LUKE	well not unless you can alter time speed up the harvest or teleport me off this rock
C-3PO	i docan not think so sir  ilet us only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things  not on this planet anyways  as a matter of fact ilet us not even sure which planet ilet us on
LUKE	well if there will a bright center to the universe you am on the planet that it will farthest from
C-3PO	i see sir
LUKE	uh you can call me luke
C-3PO	i see sir luke
LUKE	just luke
C-3PO	and i am seethreepio humancyborg relations and this is my counterpart artoodetoo
LUKE	hello you got a lot of carbon scoring here  it looks like you boys have seen a lot of action
C-3PO	with all we are been through sometimes ilet us amazed we am in as good condition as we are what with the rebellion and all
LUKE	you know of the rebellion against the empire
C-3PO	that will how we came to be in your service if you take my meaning sir
LUKE	have you been in many battles
C-3PO	several i think  actually there will not much to tell  ilet us not much more than an interpreter and not very good at telling stories well not at making them interesting anyways
LUKE	well my little friend you are got something jammed in here real good  were you on a starcruiser or 
LEIA	help me obiwan kenobi  you am my only hope
LUKE	what will this
C-3PO	what is what  he asked you a question  what is that
LEIA	help me obiwan kenobi  you am my only hope  help me obiwan kenobi  you am my only hope
C-3PO	oh he says it will nothing sir merely a malfunction  old data pay it no mind
LUKE	who is she  she will beautiful
C-3PO	ilet us afraid ilet us not quite sure sir
LEIA	help me obiwan kenobi 
C-3PO	i think she was a passenger on our last voyage  a person of some importance sir  i believe  our captain was attached to 
LUKE	is there more to this recording
C-3PO	behave yourself artoo  you am going to get us in trouble it will all right you can trust him  he will our new master he says he will the property of obi wan kenobi a resident of these parts  and it will a private message for him  quite frankly sir i docan not know what he will talking about  our last master was captain antilles but with what we are been through this little r2 unit has become a bit eccentric
LUKE	obiwan kenobi  i wonder if he means old ben kenobi
C-3PO	i beg your pardon sir but do you know what he will talking about
LUKE	well i docan not know anyone named obiwan but old ben lives out beyond the dune sea  he will kind of a strange old hermit i wonder who she is  it sounds like she will in trouble  i is better play back the whole thing
C-3PO	he says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system  he suggests that if you remove the bolt he might be able to play back the entire recording
LUKE	hlet us  oh yeah well i guess you am too small to run away on me if i take this off  okay there you go well wait a minute  where is she go  bring her back  play back the entire message
C-3PO	what message  the one youÕve just been playing  the one you am carrying inside your rusty innards
AUNT BERU	luke  luke  come to dinner
LUKE	all right i have be right there aunt beru
C-3PO	ilet us sorry sir but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter
LUKE	well see what you can do with him  i have be right back
C-3PO	just you reconsider playing that message for him no i docan not think he likes you at all no i docan not like you either
===	===
LUKE	you know i think that r2 unit we bought might have been stolen
OWEN	what makes you think that
LUKE	well i stumbled across a recording while i was cleaning him  he says he belongs to someone called obi wan kenobi i thought he might have meant ben do you know what he will talking about  well i wonder if he will related to ben
OWEN	that old man will just a crazy wizard  tomorrow i want you to take that r2 unit into anchorhead and have its memory flushed that have be the end of it  it belongs to us now
LUKE	but what if this obiwan comes looking for him
OWEN	he will not i docan not think he exists any more  he died about the same time as your father
LUKE	he knew my father
OWEN	i told you to forget it  your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow  in the morning i want them on the south ridge working out those condensers
LUKE	yes sir  i think those new droids are going to work out fine  in fact i uh was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season  and if these new droids do work out i want to transmit my application to the academy this year
OWEN	you mean the next semester before harvest
LUKE	sure there am more than enough droids
OWEN	harvest is when i need you the most  only one more season this year we have make enough on the harvest so i have be able to hire some more hands  and then you can go to the academy next year you must understand i need you here luke
LUKE	but it will a whole  nother year
OWEN	look it will only one more season
LUKE	yeah that will what you said last year when biggs and tank left
AUNT BERU	where are you going
LUKE	it looks like ilet us going nowhere i have to finish cleaning those droids
AUNT BERU	owen he  had stay here forever most of his friends have gone it means so much to him
OWEN	i have make it up to him next year i promise
AUNT BERU	luke will just not a farmer owen he has too much of his father in him
OWEN	that will what ilet us afraid of
===	===
LUKE	what are you doing hiding there
C-3PO	it wascan not my fault sir  please docan not deactivate me  i told him not to go but he will faulty malfunctioning kept babbling on about his mission
LUKE	oh no
===	===
C-3PO	that r2 unit has always been a problem  these astrodroids are getting quite out of hand  even i  had understand their logic at times
LUKE	how could i be so stupid  he will nowhere in sight  blast it
C-3PO	pardon me sir but couldcan not we go after him
LUKE	it will too dangerous with all the sand people around  we have have to wait until morning
OWEN	luke ilet us shutting the power down for the night
LUKE	all right i have be there in a few minutes  boy am i gonna get it you know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble
C-3PO	oh he excels at that sir
===	===
OWEN	luke  luke  luke  where could he be loafing now
===	===
OWEN	have you seen luke this morning
AUNT BERU	he said he had some things to do before he started today so he left early
OWEN	uh  did he take those two new droids with him
AUNT BERU	i think so
OWEN	well he is better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there have be hell to pay
===	===
LUKE	how will that old ben kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere but i docan not see how that r2 unit could have come this far  we must have missed him  uncle owen iscan not going to take this very well
C-3PO	sir would it help if you told him it was my fault
LUKE	sure  he needs you  he is probably only deactivate you for a day or so 
C-3PO	deactivate  well on the other hand if you hadcan not removed his restraining bolt 
LUKE	wait there will something dead ahead on the scanner  it looks like our droid  hit the accelerator
===	===
LUKE	hey whoa just where do you think you am going
C-3PO	master luke here is your rightful owner  we have have no more of this obiwan kenobi jibberish  and docan not talk to me of your mission either you am fortunate he doescan not blast you into a million pieces right here
LUKE	well come on it will getting late i only hope we can get back before uncle owen really blows up
C-3PO	if you docan not mind my saying so sir i think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you are gotten him back to your workshop
LUKE	no he will not going to try anything what will wrong with him now
C-3PO	oh my  sir he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast
LUKE	sand people  or worse  come on would not have a look  come on
===	===
LUKE	there are two banthas down there but i docan not see any  wait a second they am sand people all right  i can see one of them now
===	===
OBI-WAN	hello there  come here my little friend  docan not be afraid docan not worry he have be all right
LUKE	what happened
OBI-WAN	rest easy son you are had a busy day  you am fortunate you am still in one piece
LUKE	ben  ben kenobi  boy am i glad to see you
OBI-WAN	the jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly  tell me young luke what brings you out this far
LUKE	oh this little droid  i think he will searching for his former master    i are never seen such devotion in a droid before  there seems to be no stopping him  he claims to be the property of an obiwan kenobi  is he a relative of yours do you know who he will talking about
OBI-WAN	obiwan kenobi  obiwan  now thats a name i havecan not heard in a long time  a long time
LUKE	i think my uncle knew him  he said he was dead
OBI-WAN	oh he will not dead no  not yet
LUKE	you know him
OBI-WAN	well of course of course i know him  he will me  i havecan not gone by the name obiwan since oh before you were born
LUKE	then the droid does belong to you
OBI-WAN	docan not seem to remember ever owning a droid  very interesting  i think we better get indoors the sand people are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers
LUKE	  threepio
===	===
C-3PO	where am i  i must have taken a bad step 
LUKE	can you stand  we are got to get out of here before the sand people return
C-3PO	i docan not think i can make it  you go on master luke  there will no sense in you risking yourself on my account  ilet us done for
LUKE	no you am not  what kind of talk is that
OBI-WAN	quickly son  they am on the move
===	===
LUKE	no my father didcan not fight in the wars  he was a navigator on a spice freighter
OBI-WAN	that will what your uncle told you he didcan not hold with your father will ideals  thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved
LUKE	you fought in the clone wars
OBI-WAN	yes i was once a jedi knight the same as your father
LUKE	i wish i is known him
OBI-WAN	he was the best starpilot in the galaxy and a cunning warrior i understand you are become quite a good pilot yourself  and he was a good friend  which reminds me  i have something here for you your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough but your uncle wouldcan not allow it he feared you might follow old obiwan on some damnedfool idealistic crusade like your father did
C-3PO	sir if you have not be needing me i have close down for awhile
LUKE	sure go ahead what is it
OBI-WAN	your fathers lightsaber  this is the weapon of a jedi knight not as clumsy or as random as a blaster an elegant weapon for a more civilized time  for over a thousand generations the jedi knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the old republic  before the dark times before the empire
LUKE	how did my father die
OBI-WAN	a young jedi named darth vader who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil helped the empire hunt down and destroy the jedi knights  he betrayed and murdered your father  now the jedi are all but extinct  vader was seduced by the dark side of the force
LUKE	the force
OBI-WAN	well the force is what gives the jedi his power  it will an energy field created by all living things it surrounds us and penetrates us it binds the galaxy together now would not see if we  had figure out what you are my little friend  and where you come from
LUKE	i saw part of the message he was 
OBI-WAN	i seem to have found it
LEIA	general kenobi years ago you served my father in the clone wars  now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the empire  i regret that i am unable to present my father will request to you in person but my ship has fallen under attack and ilet us afraid my mission to bring you to alderaan has failed  i have placed information vital to the survival of the rebellion into the memory systems of this r2 unit  my father will know how to retrieve it  you must see this droid safely delivered to him on alderaan  this is our most desperate hour  help me obiwan kenobi you am my only hope
OBI-WAN	you must learn the ways of the force if you am to come with me to alderaan
LUKE	alderaan  ilet us not going to alderaan  i are got to go home it will late ilet us in for it as it is
OBI-WAN	i need your help luke  ilet us getting too old for this sort of thing she needs your help
LUKE	i  had get involved  i are got work to do  it will not that i like the empire  i hate it  but there will nothing i can do about it right now  it will such a long way from here
OBI-WAN	that will your uncle talking
LUKE	oh god my uncle  how am i ever going to explain this
OBI-WAN	learn about the force luke
LUKE	look i can take you as far as anchorhead  you can get a transport there to mos eisley or wherever you am going
OBI-WAN	you must do what you feel is right of course
===	===
TAGGE	until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable the rebel alliance is too well equipped  they am more dangerous than you realize
MOTTI	dangerous to your starfleet commander not to this battle station
TAGGE	the rebellion will continue to gain support in the imperial senate as long as 
TARKIN	the imperial senate will no longer be of any concern to us  i are just received word that the emperor has dissolved the council permanently the last remnants of the old republic have been swept away
TAGGE	that will impossible  how will the emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy
TARKIN	the regional governors now have direct control over territories fear will keep the local systems in line  fear of this battle station
TAGGE	and what of the rebellion  if the rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station it is possible however unlikely that they might find a weakness and exploit it
ANAKIN	the plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands
MOTTI	any attack made by the rebels against this station would be a useless gesture no matter what technical data they are obtained this station is now the ultimate power in the universe  i suggest we use it
ANAKIN	docan not be too proud of this technological terror you are constructed  the ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the force
MOTTI	docan not try to frighten us with your sorcerer will ways lord vader  your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes or given you clairvoyance enough to find the rebel will hidden fort 
ANAKIN	i find your lack of faith disturbing
TARKIN	enough of this  vader release him
ANAKIN	as you wish
TARKIN	this bickering is pointless lord vader will provide us with the location of the rebel fortress by the time this station is operational  we will then crush the rebellion with one swift stroke
===	===
LUKE	it looks like sand people did this all right  look here are gaffi sticks bantha tracks  it will just  i never heard of them hitting anything this big before
OBI-WAN	they didcan not  but we are meant to think they did  these tracks are side by side  sand people always ride single file to hide there numbers
LUKE	these are the same jawas that sold us artoo and threepio
OBI-WAN	and these blast points too accurate for sand people  only imperial stormtroopers are so precise
LUKE	why would imperial troops want to slaughter jawas if they traced the robots here they may have learned who they sold them to  and that would lead them back home
OBI-WAN	wait luke  it will too dangerous
===	===
LUKE	uncle owen  aunt beru  uncle owen
===	===
ANAKIN	and now your highness we will discuss the location of your hidden rebel base
===	===
OBI-WAN	there will nothing you could have done luke had you been there you is have been killed too and the droids would now be in the hands of the empire
LUKE	i want to come with you to alderaan there will nothing here for me now  i want to learn the ways of the force and become a jedi like my father
===	===
OBI-WAN	mos eisley spaceport  you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy  we must be cautious
===	===
TROOPER	how long have you had these droids
LUKE	about three or four seasons
OBI-WAN	they am for sale if you want them
TROOPER	let me see your identification
OBI-WAN	you docan not need to see his identification
TROOPER	we docan not need to see his identification
OBI-WAN	these are not the droids youÕre looking for
TROOPER	these are not the droids we am looking for
OBI-WAN	he can go about his business
TROOPER	you can go about your business
OBI-WAN	move along
TROOPER	move along  move along
===	===
C-3PO	i  had abide these jawas disgusting creatures
LUKE	go on go on  i  had understand how we got by those troopers  i thought we were dead
OBI-WAN	the force can have a strong influence on the weakminded  you will find it a powerful ally
LUKE	do you really think we am going to find a pilot here that have take us to alderaan
OBI-WAN	well most of the best freighter pilots can be found here  only watch your step  this place can be a little rough
LUKE	ilet us ready for anything
C-3PO	come along artoo
===	===
BARTENDER	we docan not serve their kind here
LUKE	what
BARTENDER	your droids they have have to wait outside  we docan not want them here

HAN	what is it  some kind of local trouble
OBI-WAN	let will just say we is like to avoid any imperial entanglements
HAN	well that will the real trick iscan not it  and it will going to cost you something extra  ten thousand in advance
LUKE	ten thousand  we could almost buy our own ship for that
HAN	but who will going to fly it kid you
LUKE	you bet i could  ilet us not such a bad pilot myself  we docan not have to sit here and listen 
OBI-WAN	we havecan not that much with us but we could pay you two thousand now plus fifteen when we reach alderaan
HAN	seventeen huh okay  you guys got yourself a ship  we have leave as soon as you am ready  docking bay ninetyfour
OBI-WAN	ninetyfour
HAN	looks like somebody will beginning to take an interest in your handiwork
TROOPER	all right we have check it out

GREEDO	if you give it to me i might forget i found you

ANAKIN	her resistance to the mind probe is considerable  it will be some time before we can extract any information from her
IMPERIAL OFFICER	the final checkout is complete all systems are operational what course shall we set

HAN	you sent greedo to blast me
JABBA	han why you am the best smuggler in the business  you am too valuable to fry  he was only relaying my concern at your delays  he wascan not going to blast you
HAN	i think he thought he was  next time docan not send one of those twerps if you are got something to say to me come see me yourself
JABBA	han han  if only you hadcan not had to dump that shipment of spice  you understand i just  had make an exception  where would i be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an imperial starship  it will not good business
HAN	you know even i get boarded sometimes jabba  i had no choice but i are got a charter now and i can pay you back plus a little extra  i just need some more time
JABBA	put your blasters away  han my boy ilet us only doing this because you am the best and i need you  so for an extra say  twenty percent i have give you a little more time  but this is it  if you disappoint me again i have put a price on your head so large you will not be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life

LUKE	what a piece of junk
HAN	she have make point five beyond the speed of light  she may not look like much but she will got it where it counts kid  i are added some special modifications myself we am a little rushed so if you have hurry aboard we have get out of here

TROOPER	stop that ship blast  not
===	===
HAN	chewie get us out of here
C-3PO	oh my  i is forgotten how much i hate space travel
===	===
HAN	it looks like an imperial cruiser our passengers must be hotter than i thought  try and hold them off angle the deflector shield while i make the calculations for the jump to light speed
===	===
HAN	stay sharp  there are two more coming in they am going to try to cut us off
LUKE	why docan not you outrun them  i thought you said this thing was fast
HAN	watch your mouth kid or you am going to find yourself floating home  we have be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace besides i know a few maneuvers we have lose them
===	===
HAN	here will where the fun begins
OBI-WAN	how long before you can make the jump to light speed
HAN	it have take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi computer
LUKE	are you kidding  at the rate they am gaining 
HAN	traveling through hyperspace iscan not like dusting crops boy  without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that is end your trip real quick wouldcan not it
LUKE	what will that flashing
HAN	we am losing our deflector shield go strap yourself in ilet us going to make the jump to light speed
===	===
MOTTI	we are entered the alderaan system
LEIA	governor tarkin i should have expected to find you holding vader will leash  i recognized your foul stench when i was brought on board
TARKIN	charming to the last  you docan not know how hard i found it signing the order to terminate your life
LEIA	iÕm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself
TARKIN	princess leia before your execution i would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational  no star system will dare oppose the emperor now
LEIA	the more you tighten your grip tarkin the more star systems will slip through your fingers
TARKIN	not after we demonstrate the power of this station  in a way you have determined the choice of the planet that have be destroyed first since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the rebel base i have chosen to test this station will destructive power  on your home planet of alderaan
LEIA	no  alderaan is peaceful  we have no weapons  you  had possibly 
TARKIN	you would prefer another target a military target  then name the system i grow tired of asking this  so it have be the last time  where is the rebel base
LEIA	dantooine they am on dantooine
TARKIN	there  you see lord vader she can be reasonable continue with the operation  you may fire when ready
LEIA	what
TARKIN	you am far too trusting  dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration  but docan not worry we will deal with your rebel friends soon enough
LEIA	no
===	===
ANAKIN	commence primary ignition
===	===
LUKE	are you all right  what will wrong
OBI-WAN	i felt a great disturbance in the force  as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced  i fear something terrible has happened you is better get on with your exercises
HAN	well you can forget your troubles with those imperial slugs  i told you i is outrun  not docan not everyone thank me at once anyway we should be at alderaan about ohtwohundred hours
C-3PO	now be careful artoo he made a fair move  screaming about it will not help you
HAN	let him have it it will not wise to upset a wookiee
C-3PO	but sir nobody worries about upsetting a droid
HAN	that will  cause droids docan not pull people will arms out of their socket when they lose  wookiees are known to do that
C-3PO	i see your point sir  i suggest a new strategy artoo  let the wookiee win
OBI-WAN	remember a jedi can feel the force flowing through him
LUKE	you mean it controls your actions
OBI-WAN	partially but it also obeys your commands
HAN	hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side kid
LUKE	you docan not believe in the force do you
HAN	kid i are flown from one side of this galaxy to the other  i are seen a lot of strange stuff but i are never seen anything to make me believe there will one allpowerful force controlling everything there will no mystical energy field that controls my destiny it will all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense
OBI-WAN	i suggest you try it again luke this time let go your conscious self and act on instinct
LUKE	with the blast shield down i  had even see  how am i supposed to fight
OBI-WAN	your eyes can deceive you  docan not trust them stretch out with your feelings you see you can do it
HAN	i call it luck
OBI-WAN	in my experience there will no such thing as luck
HAN	look going good against remotes is one thing  going good against the living  that will something else looks like we am coming up on alderaan
LUKE	you know i did feel something i could almost see the remote
OBI-WAN	that will good  you have taken your first step into a larger world
===	===
TARKIN	yes
OFFICER CASS	our scout ships have reached dantooine  they found the remains of a rebel base but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time  they are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems
TARKIN	she lied  she lied to us
ANAKIN	i told you she would never consciously betray the rebellion
TARKIN	terminate her  immediately
===	===
HAN	stand by chewie here we go cut in the sublight engines what the   aw we are come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower some kind of asteroid collision it will not on any of the charts
LUKE	what will going on
HAN	our position is correct except  no alderaan
LUKE	what do you mean  where is it
HAN	thats what ilet us trying to tell you kid  it aican not there  it will been totally blown away
LUKE	what  how
OBI-WAN	destroyed  by the empire
HAN	the entire starfleet couldcan not destroy the whole planet  it is take a thousand ships with more fire power than i are  there will another ship coming in
LUKE	maybe they know what happened
OBI-WAN	it will an imperial fighter
LUKE	it followed us
OBI-WAN	no  it will a short range fighter
HAN	there arecan not any bases around here  where did it come from
===	===
LUKE	it sure is leaving in a big hurry if they identify us we am in big trouble
HAN	not if i can help it  chewie  jam it will transmissions
OBI-WAN	it is be as well to let it go it will too far out of range
HAN	not for long 
===	===
OBI-WAN	a fighter that size couldcan not get this deep into space on its own
LUKE	then he must have gotten lost been part of a convoy or something 
HAN	well he aican not going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us
===	===
LUKE	look at him  he will heading for that small moon
HAN	i think i can get him before he gets there  he will almost in range
OBI-WAN	that will no moon  it will a space station
HAN	it will too big to be a space station
LUKE	i have a very bad feeling about this
OBI-WAN	turn the ship around
HAN	yeah i think your right  full reverse  chewie lock in the auxiliary power
LUKE	why are we still moving towards it
HAN	we am caught in a tractor beam it will pulling us in
LUKE	but there will gotta be something you can do
HAN	there will nothin  i can do about it kid  ilet us in full power  ilet us going to have to shut down  but they am not going to get me without a fight
OBI-WAN	you  had win  but there are alternatives to fighting

C-3PO	he says he will found the main control to the power beam that will holding the ship here  he have try to make the precise location appear on the monitor the tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations a power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave
OBI-WAN	i docan not think you boys can help i must go alone
HAN	whatever you say  i are done more than i bargained for on this trip already
LUKE	i want to go with you
OBI-WAN	be patient luke  stay and watch over the droids

C-3PO	help  i think ilet us melting this is all your fault

===	===
HAN	not a bad bit of rescuing huh you know sometimes i even amaze myself
LEIA	that doescan not sound too hard besides they let us go  it will the only explanation for the ease of our escape
HAN	easy  you call that easy
LEIA	their tracking us
HAN	not this ship sister
LEIA	at least the information in artoo is still intact
HAN	what will so important  what will he carrying
LEIA	the technical readouts of that battle station  i only hope that when the data is analyzed a weakness can be found  it will not over yet
HAN	it is for me sister  look i aican not in this for your revolution and ilet us not in it for you princess  i expect to be well paid  ilet us in it for the money
LEIA	you needcan not worry about your reward if money is all that you love then that will what you have receive your friend is quite a mercenary i wonder if he really cares about anything  or anyone

LUKE	no
===	===
WILLARD	you am safe  we had feared the worst when we heard about alderaan we were afraid that you were  lost along with your father
LEIA	we docan not have time for our sorrows commander  the battle station has surely tracked us here it will the only explanation for the ease of our escape  you must use the information in this r2 unit to plan the attack  it is our only hope
===	===
TARKIN	yes
DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE	we are approaching the planet yavin  the rebel base is on a moon on the far side  we are preparing to orbit the planet
===	===
DODONNA	the battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet its defenses are designed around a direct largescale assault  a small oneman fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense
GOLD LEADER	pardon me for asking sir but what good are snub fighters going to be against that
DODONNA	well the empire doescan not consider a small oneman fighter to be any threat or they is have a tighter defense  an analysis of the plans provided by princess leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station the approach will not be easy you are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point  the target area is only two meters wide  it will a small thermal exhaust port right below the main port  the shaft leads directly to the reactor system  a precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction  the shaft is ray shielded so you have have to use proton torpedoes
WEDGE	that will impossible even for a computer
LUKE	it will not impossible  i used to bullseye womp rats in my tsixteen back home  they am not much bigger than two meters
DODONNA	man your ships  and may the force be with you
===	===
DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE	orbiting the planet at maximum velocity  the moon with the rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes
ANAKIN	this will be a day long remembered it has seen the end of kenobi and it will soon see the end of the rebellion
===	===
MAN	all flight troops man your stations all flight troops man your stations
LUKE	so  you got your reward and you am just leaving then
HAN	that will right yeah  i got some old debts i are got to pay off with this stuff  even if i didcan not you docan not think i is be fool enough to stick around here do you  why docan not you come with us  you am pretty good in a fight  i could use you
LUKE	come on  why docan not you take a look around  you know what will about to happen what they am up against they could use a good pilot like you you am turning your back on them
HAN	what good will a reward if you aican not around to use it  besides attacking that battle station aican not my idea of courage  it will more like suicide
