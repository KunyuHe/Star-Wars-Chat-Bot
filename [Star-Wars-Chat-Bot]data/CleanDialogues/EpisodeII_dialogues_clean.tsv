PADME	corde 
CORDE	  ilet us sorry m lady  ilet us  not sure i 
AMIDALA	no  no  no  i should not have come back
CAPTAIN TYPHO	m lady you are still in danger this vote is very important you did your duty and corde did hers now come she doescan not respond m lady please
===	===
MAS AMEDDA	order we shall have order the motion for the republic to commission an army takes precedent and that is what we will vote on at this time
DARTH SIDIOUS	 my esteemed colleagues excuse me  i have just received some tragic and disturbing news senator amidala of the naboo system  has been assassinated this grievous blow is especially personal to me before i became chancellor i served amidala when she was queen she was a great leader who fought for justice not only in this honourable assembly but also on her home planet she was so loved she could have been elected queen for life she believed in public service and she fervently believed in democracy her death is a great loss to us all we will all mourn her as a relentless champion of freedom  and as a dear friend
SENATOR ASK AAK	how many more senators will die before this civil strife ends we must confront these rebels now and they need an army to do it
AMBASSADOR DARSANA	why werecan not the jedi able to stop this assassination we are no longer safe under their protection
ORN FREE TAA	the republic needs more security now before it comes to war
DARTH SIDIOUS	must i remind the senator from malastare that negotiations are continuing with the separatists peace is our objective here  not war
AMIDALA	my noble colleagues i concur with the supreme chancellor at all costs we do not want war
DARTH SIDIOUS	it is with great surprise and joy the chair recognises the senator from naboo padme amidala
PADME	less than an hour ago an assassination attempt was made against my life one of my bodyguards and six  others were ruthlessly and senselessly murdered i was the target but more importantly i believe this security measure before you was the target i have led the opposition to build an army  but there is someone in this body who will stop at nothing to assure it will passage  i warn you if you vote to create this army war will follow i have experienced the misery of war firsthand i do not wish to do it again wake up senators  you must wake up if you offer the separatists violence they can only show us violence in return many will lose their lives all will lose their freedom this decision could very well destroy the very foundation of our great republic i pray you do not let fear push you into a disastrous decision vote down this security measure which is nothing less than a declaration of war does anyone here want that i cannot believe they do
ORN FREE TAA	my motion to defer the vote must be dealt with first that is the rule of law
DARTH SIDIOUS	due to the lateness of the hour and the seriousness of this motion we will take up these matters tomorrow until then the senate stands adjourned
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	i docan not know how much longer i can hold off the vote my friends more and more star systems are joining the separatists
MACE WINDU	if they do break away 
DARTH SIDIOUS	no i will not let that happen
MACE WINDU	but if they do you must realise there arecan not enough jedi to protect the republic we are keepers of the peace not soldiers
DARTH SIDIOUS	master yoda do you think it will really come to war
YODA	worse than war i fear  much worse
DARTH SIDIOUS	what
MACE WINDU	what do you sense master
YODA	impossible to see   the dark side clouds everything but this i am sure of  do their duty the jedi will
DAR WAC	the loyalist committee has arrived my lord
DARTH SIDIOUS	send them in
YODA	with you the force is strong  young senator to see you alive brings warm feeling to my heart
PADME	thank you master yoda do you have any idea who was behind the attack
MACE WINDU	our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners on the moons of naboo
PADME	i docan not wish to disagree but i think that count dooku was behind it
MACE WINDU	you know m lady count dooku was once a jedi he wouldcan not assassinate anyone it is not in his character
KI-ADI-MUNDI	he is a political idealist not a murderer
YODA	in dark times nothing is what it appears to be but the fact remains senator in grave danger you are
DARTH SIDIOUS	count dooku has always avoided any kind of conflict it appears he has no desire to start a war why would he kill you to what end
PADME	i docan not know but everything in my being tells me he was behind it 
DARTH SIDIOUS	master jedi may i suggest that the senator be placed under the protection of your graces
BAIL ORGANA	do you think that is a wise use of manpower during these stressful times
PADME	chancellor if i may comment i do not believe the 
DARTH SIDIOUS	  situation is that serious  no but i do senator
PADME	chancellor please i docan not want any more guards
DARTH SIDIOUS	i realise all too well that additional security might be disruptive for you but perhaps someone you are familiar with  an old friend like  master kenobi 
MACE WINDU	that will possible he has just returned from a border dispute on ansion
DARTH SIDIOUS	you must remember him m lady  he watched over you during the blockade conflict
PADME	this is not necessary chancellor
DARTH SIDIOUS	do it for me m lady please i will rest easier we had a big scare today the thought of losing you is unbearable
MACE WINDU	i will have obiwan report to you immediately m lady
YODA	too little about yourself you worry senator and too much about politics be mindful of your danger padme accept our help
DARTH SIDIOUS	i will not like this republiv that has stood for over a thousand years be split in two

PADME	i docan not need more security i need answers i want to know who is trying to kill me
OBI-WAN	we am here to protect you senator not to start an investigation
ANAKIN	we will find out who is trying to kill you padme i promise you
OBI-WAN	we are not going to exceed our mandate my young padawan learner
ANAKIN	i meant in the interest of protecting her master of course
OBI-WAN	we are not going through this exercise again anakin you will pay attention to my lead
ANAKIN	why
OBI-WAN	what
ANAKIN	why else do you think we were assigned to her if not to find the killer protection is a job for local security  not jedi it will overkill master investigation is implied in our mandate
OBI-WAN	we will do as the council has instructed and you will learn your place young one
PADME	perhaps with merely your presence the mysteries surrounding this threat will be revealed  now if you will excuse me i will retire

===	===
MACE WINDU	why couldcan not we see this attack on the senator
YODA	masking the future is this disturbance in the force
MACE WINDU	the propecy is coming true the dark side is growing
YODA	and only those who have turned to the dark side can sense the possibilities of the future only going through the dark side can we see
MACE WINDU	it will been ten years and the sith still have no shown themselves do you think they are behind this
YODA	 out there they are a certainty that is
MACE WINDU	do you think obiwan will apprentice will be able to bring balance to the force
YODA	only if he chooses to follow his destiny
===	===
OBI-WAN	captain typho has more than enough men downstairs no assassin will try that way any activity up here
ANAKIN	quiet as a tomb i docan not like just waiting here for something to happen to her
OBI-WAN	what will going on
ANAKIN	she covered that camera i docan not think she liked me watching her
OBI-WAN	what is she thinking
ANAKIN	she programmed artoo to warn us if there will an intruder
OBI-WAN	it will not an intruder ilet us worried about there are many other ways to kill a senator
ANAKIN	i know but we also want to catch this assassin docan not we master
OBI-WAN	you am using her as bait

OBI-WAN	mind your thoughts anakin they betray you you are made a commitment to the jedi order  a commitment not easily broken  and docan not forget she will a politician they am not to be trusted
ANAKIN	she will not like the others in the senate master
OBI-WAN	it will been my experience that senators are only focused on pleasing those who fund their campaigns  and they are more than willing to forget the niceties of democracy to get those funds
ANAKIN	not another lecture master not on the economics of politics  it will too early in the morning  and besides you am generalising the chancellor doescan not appear to be corrupt
OBI-WAN	palpatine will a politician i are observed that he is very clever at following the passions and prejudices of the senators
ANAKIN	i think he is a good man my instincts are very positive about 
OBI-WAN	i sense it too

PADME	i havecan not worked for a year to defeat the  military creation act  not to be here when its fate is decided
ANAKIN	sometimes we have to let go of our pride and do what is requested of us

ANAKIN	master obiwan manages not to see it 
PADME	mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like it will the only way we grow
ANAKIN	docan not get me wrong  obiwan is a great mentor as wise as master yoda and as powerful as master windu i am truly thankful to be his apprentice only  although ilet us a padawan learner in some ways  a lot of ways  ilet us ahead of him ilet us ready for the trials i know i am he knows it too he believes ilet us too unpredictable  other jedi my age have gone through the trials and made it  i know i started my training late  but he will not let me move on
PADME	that must be frustrating
ANAKIN	it will worse  he will overly critical he never listens he just doescan not understand it will not fair

SERVER	keep moving keep moving
FOOD SERVER	hey no droids
ANAKIN	no no mom no  what
PADME	you seemed to be having a nightmare are you hungry
ANAKIN	thank you
PADME	we went into lightspeed a while ago
ANAKIN	i look forward to seeing naboo again i are thought about it every day since i left it will by far the most beautiful place i are ever seen 
PADME	you were just a little boy then it may not be as you remember it time changes your perception
ANAKIN	i think time has given me much more mature feelings to enhance my perception
PADME	it must be difficult having sworn your life to the jedi  not being able to visit the places you like  or do the things you like 
ANAKIN	or be with the people i love
PADME	are you allowed to love i thought that was forbidden for a jedi
ANAKIN	attachment is forbidden possession is forbidden compassion which i would define as unconditional love is central to a jedi will life so you might say we am encouraged to love
PADME	you have changed so much
ANAKIN	you havecan not changed a bit you am exactly the way i remember you in my dreams i doubt if naboo has changed much either
PADME	it hascan not 
ANAKIN	i  had wait to breathe the sweet breeze that comes off the rolling hills whenever i try to visualise the force those hills are what i see i love naboo
PADME	were you dreaming about you mother earlier werecan not you
ANAKIN	yes  i left tatooine so long ago my memory of her is fading i docan not want to lose it recently i are been seeing her in my dreams  vivid dreams  scary dreams i worry about her

HERMIONE	can i help ya
OBI-WAN	ilet us looking for dexter
HERMIONE BAGWA	waddya want him for
OBI-WAN	he will not in trouble it will personal
HERMIONE BAGWA	someone to see ya honey a jedi by the looks of him
DEXTER JETTSTER	obiwan
OBI-WAN	hey dex
DEXTER JETTSTER	take a seat be right with ya
HERMIONE BAGWA	you want a cup of ardees
OBI-WAN	thank you
DEXTER JETTSTER	hey ol  buddy
OBI-WAN	hey dex
DEXTER JETTSTER	so my friend what can i do for ya
OBI-WAN	you can tell me what this is
DEXTER JETTSTER	well whattaya know  i aican not seen one of these since i was prospecting on subterrel beyond the outer rim
OBI-WAN	do you know where it came from
DEXTER JETTSTER	this baby belongs to them cloners what you got here is a kamino kyberdart
OBI-WAN	kamino kyberdart  i wonder why it didcan not show up in any analysis archive
DEXTER JETTSTER	it will these funny little cuts on the side give it away  those analysis droids you are got over there only focus on symbols you know i should think you jedi would have more respect for the difference between knowledge and wisdom
OBI-WAN	well dex if droids could think we wouldcan not be here would we kamino  doescan not sound familiar is it part of the republic
DEXTER JETTSTER	no it will beyond the outer rim i is say about twelve parsecs outside the rishi maze toward the south it should be easy to find even for those droids in your archive to find those kaminoans keep to themselves they am cloners damned good ones too
OBI-WAN	cloners are they friendly
DEXTER JETTSTER	it depends
OBI-WAN	on what dex
DEXTER JETTSTER	on how good your manners are  and how big your pocketbook is 
===	===
ANAKIN	if i grew up here i docan not think i is ever leave
PADME	i doubt that
ANAKIN	no really when i started my training i was very homesick and very lonely this city and my mom were the only pleasant things i had to think about  the problem was the more i thought about my mom the worse i felt but i would feel better if i thought about the palace  the way it shimmers in the sunlight  the way the air always smells of flowers 
PADME	 and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls the first time i saw the capital i was very young  i is never seen a waterfall before i though they were so beautiful  i never dreamed one day i is live in the palace
ANAKIN	well tell me did you dream of power and politics when you were a little girl
PADME	no that was the last thing i thought of my dream was to help in the  refugee relief movement  i never thought of running for elected office but the more history i studied the more i realised how much good politicians could do so when i was eight i joined the  apprentice legislators  then later on became a senatorial advisor with such a passion that before i knew it i was elected queen partly because i scored so high on my education certificate but for the most part it was my conviction that reform was possible i wascan not the youngest queen ever elected but now that i think back on it ilet us not sure i was old enough ilet us not sure i was ready
ANAKIN	the people you served thought you did a good job i heard they tried to amend the constitution so you could stay in office
PADME	popular rule is not democracy annie it gives the people what they want not what they need and truthfully i was relieved when my two terms were up so were my parents they worried about me during the blockade and couldcan not wait for it all to be over actually i was hoping to have a family by now  my sisters have the most amazing wonderful kids  but when the queen asked me to serve as senator i couldcan not refuse her
ANAKIN	i agree i think the republic needs you  ilet us glad you chose to serve i feel things are going to happen in our generation that will change the galaxy in profound ways
PADME	i think so too
===	===
QUEEN JAMILLIA	we are been worried about you ilet us so glad you am safe padme
PADME	thank you your highness i only wish i could have served you better by staying on coruscant for the vote
SIO BIBBLE	given the circumstances senator you know it was the only decision her highness could have made
QUEEN JAMILLIA	how many systems have joined count dooku and the separatists
PADME	about two hundred and more are leaving the republic every day if the senate votes to create an army ilet us sure it will going to push us into a civil war
SIO BIBBLE	it will unthinkable there hascan not been a fullscale war since the formation of the republic
QUEEN JAMILLIA	do you see any way through negotiations to bring the separatists back into the republic
PADME	not if they feel threatened the separatists docan not have an army but if they are provoked they will move to defend themselves ilet us sure of that and with no time or money to build an army my guess is they will turn to the commerce guilds or the trade federation for help
QUEEN JAMILLIA	the armies of commerce why has nothing been done in the senate to restrain them
PADME	ilet us afraid that despite the chancellor will best efforts there are still many bureaucrats judges and even senators on the payrolls of the guilds
SIO BIBBLE	it will outrageous after all of those hearings and the four trials in the supreme court nute gunray is still the viceroy of the trade federation do those money mongers control everything
QUEEN JAMILLIA	remember counsellor the courts were able to reduce the federation will armies that will a move in the right direction
PADME	there are rumours your highness that the federation army was not reduced as they were ordered
ANAKIN	the jedi have not been allowed to investigate it would be to be too dangerous for the economy we were told
QUEEN JAMILLIA	we must keep our faith in the republic the day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it
PADME	let will pray that day never comes
QUEEN JAMILLIA	in the meantime we must consider your own safety
SIO BIBBLE	what is your suggestion master jedi
PADME	anakin will not a jedi yet counsellor he will still a padawan learner i was thinking 
ANAKIN	hey hold on a minute
PADME	excuse me i was thinking i would stay in the lake country there are some places up there that are very isolated
ANAKIN	excuse me i am in charge of security here m lady
PADME	annie my life is at risk and this is my home i know it very well  that is why we am here i think it would be wise for you to take advantage of my knowledge in this instance
ANAKIN	sorry m lady
SIO BIBBLE	she is right the lake country is the most remote part of naboo not many people and a clear view of the surrounding terrain
QUEEN JAMILLIA	perfect it will settled then padme i had an audience with your father yesterday i told him what was happening he hopes you will visit your mother before you leave  your family will very worried about you
===	===
JOCASTA NU	did you call for assistance
OBI-WAN	yes  yes i did 
JOCASTA NU	he has a powerful face doescan not he he was one of the most brilliant jedi i have had the privilege of knowing
OBI-WAN	i never understood why he quit only twenty jedi have ever left the order
JOCASTA NU	the lost twenty  and count dooku was the most recent and the most painful no one likes to talk about it his leaving was a great loss to the order
OBI-WAN	what happened
JOCASTA NU	well one might say he was always a bit out of step with the decisions of the council  much like your old master quigon jinn
OBI-WAN	really
JOCASTA NU	oh yes they were alike in many ways very individual thinkers  idealists  he was always striving to become a more powerful jedi he wanted to be the best with a lightsaber in the old style of fencing he had no match his knowledge of the force was  unique in the end i think he left because he lost faith in the republic he believed that politics were corrupt and he felt the jedi betrayed themselves by serving the politicians he always had very high expectations of government he disappeared for nine or ten years then he just showed up recently as the head of the separatist movement
OBI-WAN	interesting  ilet us still not sure i understand
JOCASTA NU	well ilet us sure you didcan not call me over here for a history lesson are you having a problem master kenobi
OBI-WAN	yes ilet us trying to find a planet system called kamino it doescan not seem to show upon any of the archive charts
JOCASTA NU	kamino it will not a system i m familiar with  let me see  are you sure you have the right coordinates
OBI-WAN	according to my information it should be in this quadrant somewhere  just south of the rishi maze
JOCASTA NU	no coordinates it sounds like the kind of directions you is get from a street tout  some old miner or furbog trader
OBI-WAN	all three actually
JOCASTA NU	are you sure it exists
OBI-WAN	absolutely
JOCASTA NU	let me do a gravitational scan there are some inconsistencies here maybe the planet you am looking for was destroyed
OBI-WAN	wouldcan not that be on record
JOCASTA NU	it ought to be unless it was very recent i hate to say it but it looks like the system you am searching for doescan not exist
OBI-WAN	that will impossible  perhaps the archives are incomplete
JOCASTA NU	the archives are comprehensive and totally secure my young jedi one thing you may be absolutely sure of  if an item does not appear in our records it does not exist

OBI-WAN	i am sorry to disturb you master
YODA	what help to you can i be
OBI-WAN	ilet us looking for a planet described to me by an old friend i trust him but the system doescan not show up on the archive maps
YODA	an interesting puzzle gather round the map reader younglings master obiwan has lost a planet find it we will try 
OBI-WAN	this is where it ought to be  but it iscan not gravity is pulling all the stars in this area inward to this spot there should be a star here  but there iscan not
YODA	most interesting gravity will silhouette remains but the star and all its planets have disappeared how can this be
JEDI CHILD JACK	because someone erased it from the archive memory
CHILDREN	that will right yes that will what happened someone erased it
JEDI CHILD MAY	if the planet blew up the gravity would go away
YODA	truly wonderful the mind of a child is uncluttered to the centre of the pull of gravity go and find your planet you will
OBI-WAN	but master yoda who could have erased information from the archives that will impossible iscan not it
YODA	much harder to answer that question is
===	===
PADME	when i was in level three we used to come here for school retreat see that island we used to swim there every day i love the water
ANAKIN	i do too i guess it comes from growing up on a desert planet
PADME	 we used to lie on the sand and let the sun dry us  and try to guess the names of the birds singing
ANAKIN	i docan not like sand it will coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere not like here here everything will soft  and smooth 
PADME	there was a very old man who lived on the island he used to make glass out of sand  and vases and necklaces out of the glass they were magical
ANAKIN	everything here is magical
PADME	you could look into the glass and see the water the way it ripples and moves it looked so real  but it wascan not
ANAKIN	sometimes when you believe something to be real it becomes real real enough anyway 
PADME	i used to think if you looked too deeply into glass you would lose yourself
ANAKIN	i think it will true 
PADME	i shouldcan not have done that
ANAKIN	ilet us sorry when ilet us around you my mind is no longer my own
PADME	it will the situation  the stress 
ANAKIN	 the view
===	===
MACE WINDU	be wary this disturbance in the force is growing stronger
OBI-WAN	i am concerned for my padawan he is not ready to be on his own
YODA	the council is confident in this decision obiwan
MACE	he has exceptional skills the council is confident in its decision obiwan if the prophecy is true he weill be the one to bring balance to the force
OBI-WAN	but he still has much to learn and his abilities have made him  well  arrogant i realise now what you and master yoda knew from the beginning  the boy was too old to start the training and 
MACE WINDU	there will something else
OBI-WAN	master he should not have been given this assignment ilet us afraid anakin will not be able to protect the senator
MACE WINDU	why
OBI-WAN	he has a  an emotional connection with her it will been there since he was boy now he will confused  distracted
MACE-WINDU	obiwan you must have faith that he will take the right path
OBI-WAN	has master yoda gained any insight into whether or not this war will come about
MACE WINDU	probing the dark side is a dangerous process he could be in seclusion for days  may the force be with you
===	===
PADME	you did that
ANAKIN	what
PADME	that now stop it anakin
ANAKIN	ilet us not really supposed to do that  for fun i mean if master obiwan were here he is be very grumpy
===	===
ANAKIN	may i tell you something
PADME	i docan not know
ANAKIN	then how can i tell you
PADME	maybe you should use your jedi intuition
ANAKIN	it doescan not work around you my mind is always a muddle  i can only think of you
PADME	anakin docan not 
ANAKIN	from the moment i met you all those years ago a day hascan not gone by when i havecan not thought of you and now that ilet us close to you again ilet us in agony the closer i get to you the worse it gets the thought of not being with you mskes my stomach turn over  my mouth goes dry i feel dizzy i  had breathe ilet us haunted by the kiss you should never have given me my heart is beating hoping that kiss will not become a scar you are in my very soul tormenting me what can i do i will do anything you ask  if you are suffering as much as i am tell me
PADME	 i  had we  had it will just not possible
ANAKIN	anything will possible padme please listen 
PADME	you listen we live in a real world come back to it you am studying to become a jedi knight ilet us a senator if you follow your thoughts through to conclusion they will take us to a place we cannot go  regardless of the way we feel about each other
ANAKIN	then you do feel something there will an extraordinary connection between us you  had deny that
PADME	annie it doescan not make any difference jedi arecan not allowed to marry you swore an oath remember you is be expelled from the order i will not let you give up your responsibilities  your future for me
ANAKIN	i was destined to be a jedi i docan not think i could be anything else but you are asking me to be rational that is something i know i cannot do i wish i could wish my feelings away  but i  had
PADME	i am not going to give into this ilet us not going to throw my life away i have more important things to do than fall in love
ANAKIN	it wouldcan not have to be that way  we could keep it a secret
PADME	then we is be living a lie  one we couldcan not keep even if we wanted to mt sister saw it so did my mother i couldcan not do that could you anakin could you live like that

===	===
PADME	i docan not know 
ANAKIN	sure you do  you just docan not want to tell me
PADME	are you going to use one of your jedi mind tricks on me
ANAKIN	they only work on the weakminded you are anything but weakminded
PADME	all right  his name was palo i was twelve we were both in the legislative youth program he was a few years older then i  very cute  dark curly hair  dreamy eyes
ANAKIN	all right i get the picture  whatever happened to him
PADME	i went on to become a queen he went on to become an artist
ANAKIN	maybe he was the smart one
PADME	you really docan not like politicians do you
ANAKIN	i like two or three but ilet us not really sure about one of them i docan not think the system works
PADME	how would you have it work
ANAKIN	we need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problems agree what will in the best interests of all the people and then do it
PADME	that is exactly what we do the trouble is that people docan not wlways agree in fact they hardly ever do
ANAKIN	then they should be made to
PADME	by whom who will going to make them
ANAKIN	i docan not know someone
PADME	you
ANAKIN	of course not me
PADME	but someone
ANAKIN	someone wise
PADME	that sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me
ANAKIN	well if it works 
PADME	you am making fun of me
ANAKIN	on no i is be much too frightened to tease a senator
PADME	you am so bad
ANAKIN	you am always so serious always carrying the weight of the universe on your shoulders
===	===
LAMA SU	magnificent arecan not they
===	===
LAMA SU	we modified their genetic structure to make them less independent than the original host as a result they are totally obedient taking any order without question
OBI-WAM	who was the original host
LAMA SU	a bounty hunter called jango fett we felt a jedi would be the perfect choice but sidodyas hand picked jango fett himself
OBI-WAN	where is this bounty hunter now
LAMA SU	oh we keep him here after a few hundred thousand clones the genetic pattern starts to fade so we take a fresh supply he lives here but he will free to come and go as he pleases
===	===
LAMA SU	apart from his pay which is considerable fett demanded only one thing  an unaltered clone for himself curious iscan not it
OBI-WAN	unaltered
LAMA SU	pure genetic replication no tampering with the structure to make it more docile  and no growth acceleration 
OBI-WAN	i would like to meet this jango fett
TAUN WE	i would be most happy to arrange it for you
===	===
OBI-WAN	you mentioned growth acceleration 
LAMA SU	oh yes it will essential otherwise a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow now we can do it in half the time those items you saw on the parade ground were started ten years ago when sidodyas first placed the order and they am already mature 
OBI-WAN	and these
LAMA SU	about five years ago
===	===
LAMA SU	they am immensely superior to droids capable of independent thought and action
OBI-WAN	very impressive
LAMA SU	i is hoped you would be pleased
OBI-WAN	tell me prime minister when my master sidodyas first contacted you did he say the order was for  himself  or
LAMA SU	himself of course not this army is for the republic
OBI-WAN	the repubic
LAMA SU	we are also very much agasint this count dooku and his seccessionist movement we are proud to be of help to the republic

OBI-WAN	guiding light to  old folks home 
===	===
OBI-WAN	 starships from the trade federation and the commerce guilds are taking deliveries of battle droids from the foundries on geonosis
BAIL ORGANA	that will outrageous the treaty forbids the trade federation from building up an army what are they doing
OBI-WAN	the droid foundry seems to be working at full capacity i am going to go down and investigate i will bring jango fett back home for interrogation
DARTH SIDIOUS	those geonosian foundries are part of the techno union we will call in their representatives and ask them a few very pointed questions
OBI-WAN	one more thing jango mentioned he was recruited by someone named darth tyranus any idea who that might be
YODA	with the forename darth a sith he must be
MACE WINDU	our missing apprentice they are playing their hand at last
OBI-WAN	do you believe he could be the mysterious sidodyas who made the deal for the clone army
YODA	perhaps too many pieces are missing from this puzzle there are
MACE WINDU	be careful obiwan this investigation is becoming less than routine do you need help
OBI-WAN	let me see if i can figure out what will going on first
BAIL ORGANA	the commerce guilds are preparing for war  there can be no doubt of that
DARTH SIDIOUS	count dooku must have made a treaty with them
MACE WINDU	we must stop them soon before they am fully ready
SENATOR ASK AAK	the debate is over we need that clone army now
BAIL ORGANA	unfortunately the debate is not over the senate will never be able to approve the use of that army before the separatists attack
MAS AMEDDA	this is a crisis if the senate votes the chancellor emergency powers he could approve the use of the army in a minute
DARTH SIDIOUS	please please i docan not wish to have emergency powers that will too extreme a solution it will akin to a dictatorship we must rely on the jedi master yoda how many are available to go to geonosis
YODA	two hundred  less or more
BAIL ORGANA	with all due respect for the jedi order two hundred will be no match for hundreds of thousands of battle droids
MACE WINDU	patience we should wait for obi wan to report back we docan not know that count dooku has made a treaty with the corporate alliance it will speculation
SENATOR ASK AAK	but we must prepare for the worst ilet us going to propose a motion granting emergency powers to the chancellor at the next session we must not wait
DARTH SIDIOUS	out of the question senator you and i are too closely aligned the issue will become partisan and debates will begin the proposal must come from a neutral source
MAS AMEDDA	if only senator amidala were here
JAR JAR	supreme chancellor  my august colleagues i would be proud to propose the motion in question this is a grave situation and ilet us sure senator amidala and the queen of naboo would agree
SENATOR ASK AAK	thank you representative binks
DARTH SIDIOUS	if called upon i will serve but it will be the saddest day of my life
===	===
PADME	there
C-3PO	um how do i look
OWEN	great you look perfect
C-3PO	perfect oh miss padme ilet us so happy oh pardon me thank you thank you thank you thank you
OWEN	well padme i think he should be yours from now on  i know that is what my mom would want
C-3PO	oh my
BERU	come topside everybody he will back he will back
===	===
OBI-WAN	 alliance have pledged their armies to count dooku and are forming an  wait  ah  attack  i docan not  make it  aaaggghhh
ANAKIN	ilet us going after him
PADME	i thought the first thing he said was to retransmit his message to coruscant
ANAKIN	yeah you am right you am right
===	===
MACE WINDU	we will deal with count dooku the most important thing for you anakin is to stay where you are protect the senator at all costs that is your priority
ANAKIN	understood master
PADME	they have never get there in time to save him they have to come half way across the galaxy look geonosis is less than a parsec away
ANAKIN	if he will still alive
PADME	annie are you just going to sit here and let him die he will your friend  your mentor 
ANAKIN	 he will like my father but you heard master windu he gave me strict orders to stay here
PADME	he gave you strict orders to protect me   and ilet us going to save obiwan so if you plan to protect me you will have to come along
===	===
MACE WINDU	the longer we wait the stronger dooku will armies become we cannot wait for the senate to make up its mind about granting the chancellor emergency powers in order to be able to use that clone army  we have the authority to go now we must go now
YODA	agreed master windu two hundred jedi send enough would not hope they are
===	===
MAS AMEDDA	order order
DARTH SIDIOUS	in the regrettable absence of senator amidala the chair recognises senior representative of naboo jar jar binks
JAR JAR	senators dellow felagates 
MAS AMEDDA	order the senate will accord the representative the courtesy of a hearing
JAR JAR	in response to the direct threat to the republic from the confederacy of independent systems i propose that the senate gives immediate emergency powers to the supreme chancellor who can deny these are exceptional times exceptional times demand exceptional measures exceptional measures demand exceptional men
ORN FREE TAA	we will not support a dictator
JAR JAR	that is the sentiment every one of us agrees with and when the shadow of war has dispersed and the bright day of liberty has dawned once again the power we now give to the supreme chancellor will be gladly and swiftly returned out ancient liberties will be restored to us burnished even more brightly than before
DARTH SIDIOUS	it is with great reluctance that i have agreed to this calling i love democracy  i love the republic the fact that this crisis is demanding i be given absolute power to tule over you is evident but i am mild by nature and have no desire to destroy the democratic process the power you give me i will lay down when this crisis has abated i promise you and all i ask in return is when my current term of office is over you allow me to reture and live out my life in peace
MAS AMEDDA	we shall proceed to the vote all those in favor of granting emergency powers to the supreme chancellor signal ate at this time  those opposed
===	===
ANAKIN	hey where are you going
PADME	to find obiwan
ANAKIN	no you am not
PADME	let go of me
ANAKIN	ilet us not letting you go out there it will too dangerous
PADME	what
ANAKIN	it will my job to protect you i said it will too dangerous you am not going and that will final
PADME	docan not you give me orders annie ilet us a senator of the galactic republic you have no authority to contain me restrain me or direct me you remember your place young man now you can come along and protect me or stay here it will up to you
C-3PO	yes it is artoo most confusing one moment they am generating a pleasant mutual attraction and the next waves of violent hostility even though ilet us programmed to understand them i doubt if i ever shall
===	===
PADME	it will empty
===	===
PADME	wait
COUNT DOOKU	senator amidala i are heard so much about you
PADME	count dooku i assume
COUNT DOOKU	ilet us delighted to meet you at last we have a great deal to discuss senator i hope you can keep your young jedi under control
PADME	docan not worry he will housebroken
===	===
PADME	you are holding a jedi knight obi wan kenobi i am formally requesting you turn him over to me now
DOOKU	he has been convicted of espionage senator and will be executed in just a few hours i believe
PADME	he is an officer of the republic you  had do that
DOOKU	we docan not recognise the republic here senator but if naboo were to join our alliance i could easily hear your plea for clemency
PADME	and if i docan not join your rebellion i assume this jedi with me will also die
DOOKU	i docan not wish to make you to join our cause against your will senator but you are a rational honest representative of your people and i assume you want to do what will in their best interest arecan not you fed up with the corruption the bureaucrats the hypocrisy of it all arecan not you be honest senator
PADME	the ideals are still alive count even if the institution is failing
DOOKU	you believe in the same ideals we believe in the same ideals we are striving to make prominent
PADME	if what you say is true you should stay in the republic and help chancellor palpatine put things right
DOOKU	the chancellor means well m lady but he is incompetent he has promised to cut the bureaucracy but the bureaucrats are stronger than ever no senator the republic cannot be fixed it is time to start over the democratic process in the republic is a sham a shell game played on the voters it will not be long before the cult of greed called the republic will lose even the pretext of democracy and freedom
