YODA	Premonitions . . . premonitions . . . Hmmmm . . . these visions you have . . .
ANAKIN	They are of pain, suffering, death . . .
YODA	Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?
ANAKIN	Someone . . .
YODA	. . . close to you?
ANAKIN	Yes.
YODA	Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.
ANAKIN	I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda.
YODA	Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.
ANAKIN	What must I do, Master Yoda?
YODA	Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.
===	===
MACE	Anakin Skywalker, we have approved your appointment to the Council as the Chancellor's personal representative.
ANAKIN	I will do my best to uphold the principles of the Jedi Order.
YODA	Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.
ANAKIN	I understand.
MACE	You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master.
ANAKIN	What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous, it's unfair . . . I'm more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?
MACE	Take a seat, young Skywalker.
ANAKIN	Forgive me, Master.
KI-ADI-MUNDI	We have surveyed all systems in the Republic, and have found no sign of General Grievous.
YODA	Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep.
OBI-WAN	It may take some time . . . we do not have many ships to spare.
MACE	We cannot take ships from the front line.
OBI-WAN	And yet, it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup.
YODA	Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait.
KI-ADI-MUNDI	What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?
MACE	It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately!
OBI-WAN	He's right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It's the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant.
ANAKIN	I know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet.
MACE	Skywalker, your assignment is here with the Chancellor, and Kenobi must find General Grievous.
YODA	Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.
MACE	It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all.
===	===
OBI-WAN	Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.
YODA	Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.
MACE	It's very dangerous, putting them together. I don't think the boy can handle it. I don't trust him.
OBI-WAN	He'll be all right. I trust him with my life.
MACE	I wish I did.
OBI-WAN	With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?
MACE	So the prophecy says.
YODA	A prophecy . . . that misread could have been.
OBI-WAN	He will not let me down. He never has.
YODA	I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you.
===	===
KI-ADI-MUNDI	Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau. We have had no reports of this from our agents.
MACE	How could the Chancellor have come by this information and we know nothing about it? We have had contact with Baron Papanoida and he said no one was there.
ANAKIN	A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.
YODA	Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.
OBI-WAN	Does everyone agree?
ANAKIN	The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.
MACE	The Council will make up its own mind who is to go, not the Chancellor.
KI-ADI-MUNDI	Yes, this decision is ours to make.
YODA	A Master is needed, with more experience.
MACE	Given our resources, I recommend we send only one Jedi . . . Master Kenobi.
ANAKIN	He was not so successful the last time he met Grievous. No offense, my Master, but I'm only stating a fact.
OBI-WAN	Oh no, you're quite right, but I do have the most experience with his ways of combat.
YODA	Obi-Wan, my choice is.
KI-ADI-MUNDI	I concur. Master Kenobi should go.
YODA	I agree.
MACE	Very well. Council is adjourned. Obi-Wan, prepare two clone brigades as quickly as you can. If this report is true, there's no telling how many battle droids he may have with him.
===	===
CLONE COMMANDER GREE	The droids have started up their main power generators.
YODA	Then now the time is, Commander.
CLONE COMMANDER GREE	Yes, sir.
===	===
CLONE COMMANDER CODY	Master Windu, may I interrupt? General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous, and we
MACE WINDU	Thank you, Commander. Anakin, deliver this report to the Chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to his
ANAKIN	Yes, Master.
MACE WINDU	I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor.
KI-ADI-MUNDI	If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grievous, then he should be removed from
MACE WINDU	That could be a dangerous move ... the Jedi Council would have to take control of the Senate in order to secure a peaceful transition . . .
KI-ADI-MUNDI	. . . and replace the Congress with Senators who are not filled with greed and corruption.
YODA	To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmmmmm. . . . great care we must take.
===	===
AT-ST CLONE SERGEANT	Everyone out of there!
YODA	Wookiee good . . . eat Wookiee.
CLONE SERGEANT	Did you find something?
YODA	It's nothing, nothing.
CLONE SERGEANT	It's nothing, nothing. All these Wookiees are dead. Move to the east.
CLONE TROOPER	Yes, sir.
YODA	Right you are, Chewbacca. Faster that will be. Stink, this mud does. A moment to bathe, give me. Not far, are we, from the emergency ship. Quickly . . .
===	===
YODA	Good-bye. Chewbacca and Tarfful, miss you I will. Good friends you are. For your help, much gratitude and respect, I have.
===	===
BAIL ORGANA	You made it.
YODA	Master Kenobi, dark times are these. Good to see you. it is.
OBI-WAN	You were attacked by your Clones, also?
YODA	With the help of the Wookiees, barely escape, I did.
OBI-WAN	How many other Jedi managed to survive?
YODA	Heard from no one, have we.
BAIL ORGANA	I saw thousands of troops attack the Jedi Temple. That's why I went looking for Yoda.
OBI-WAN	Have we had any contact from the Temple?
YODA	Received a coded retreat message, we have.
BAIL ORGANA	It requests all Jedi to return to the Temple. It says that the war is over . . .
OBI-WAN	Well, then we must go back! If there are other stragglers, they will fall into the trap and be killed.
BAIL ORGANA	It's too dangerous to return.
YODA	Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?
OBI-WAN	Yes, Master. There is too much at stake here, and we need a clearer picture of what has happened.
YODA	I agree. In a dark place we find ourselves ... a little more knowledge might light our way.
===	===
PILOT	We are receiving a message from the Chancellor's office, sir.
BAIL ORGANA	Send it through.
PILOT	Yes, sir.
MAS AMEDDA	Senator Organa . . . the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic requests your presence at a special session of Congress.
BAIL ORGANA	Tell the Chancellor I will be there.
MAS AMEDDA	Very well. He will be expecting you.
BAIL ORGANA	It could be a trap.
OBI-WAN	No, I don't think so. The Chancellor will not be able to control the thousands of star systems without keeping the Senate intact.
YODA	If a special session of Congress there is, easier for us to enter the Jedi Temple it will be.
===	===
OBI-WAN	There are several battalions of Clone Troopers on every level. Many are dressed as Jedi.
YODA	Dismantle the coded signal quickly. That group back there, soon discovered will be.
===	===
OBI-WAN	Not even the younglings survived.
YODA	Killed not by clones, this Padawan. By a lightsaber, he was.
OBI-WAN	. . .Who?? Who could have done this?
===	===
OBI-WAN	I've recalibrated the code warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.
YODA	Good . . . For the Clones to discover the recalibration, a long time it will take. To change it back, longer still. Hurry.
===	===
OBI-WAN	Wait, Master. There is something I must know . . .
YODA	If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.
OBI-WAN	I must know the truth, Master. It can't be . . . It can't be . . .
ANAKIN	The traitors have been taken care of, Lord Sidious.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Good . . . good . . . You have done well, my new apprentice. Do you feel your power growing?
ANAKIN	Yes, My Master.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Now, Lord Vader, now go and bring peace to the Empire.
OBI-WAN	I can't watch any more.
YODA	Destroy the Sith, we must.
OBI-WAN	Send me to kill the Emperor. I will not kill Anakin.
YODA	To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not.
OBI-WAN	He is like my brother ... I cannot do it.
YODA	Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has become. The boy you trained, gone he is . . . Consumed by Darth Vader.
OBI-WAN	How could it have come to this?
YODA	To question, no time there is.
OBI-WAN	I do not know where the Emperor has sent him. I don't know where to look.
YODA	Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him, you will. Visit the new Emperor, my task is. May the Force be with you.
OBI-WAN	May the Force be with you, Master Yoda.
===	===
YODA	I hear a new apprentice, you have. Emperor, or should I call you Darth Sidious.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Master Yoda, you survived.
YODA	Surprised?
DARTH SIDIOUS	Your arrogance blinds you, Master Yoda. Now you will experience the full power of the dark side.
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	I have waited a long time for this moment, my little green friend. At last, the Jedi are no more.
YODA	Not if anything I have to say about it, Lord Sidious. At an end your rule is and not short enough it was, I must say. If so powerful you are, why leave??
DARTH SIDIOUS	You will not stop me. Darth Vader will become more powerful than either of us.
YODA	Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be, as is your faith in the dark side of the Force.
===	===
YODA	Destroy you I will, just as Master Kenobi, your apprentice will destroy.
===	===
YODA	Hurry. Careful timing we will need.
BAIL ORGANA	There aren't many troops on this side. Activate your homing beacon when you're ready.
===	===
YODA	Into exile I must go. Failed, I have.
===	===
YODA	Failed to stop the Sith Lord, I have. Still much to learn, there is ...
QUI-GON	Patience. You will have time. I did not. When I became one with the Force I made a great discovery. With my training, you will be able to merge with the Force at will. Your physical self will fade away, but you will still retain your consciousness. You will become more powerful than any Sith.
YODA	Eternal consciousness.
QUI-GON	The ability to defy oblivion can be achieved, but only for oneself. It was accomplished by a Shaman of the Whills. It is a state acquired through compassion, not greed.
YODA	. . . to become one with the Force, and influence still have . . . A power greater than all, it is.
QUI-GON	You will learn to let go of everything. No attachment, no thought of self. No physical self.
YODA	A great Jedi Master, you have become, Qui-Gon Jinn. Your apprentice I gratefully become.
BAIL ORGANA	Excuse me, Master Yoda. Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.
===	===
MEDICAL DROID	Medically, she is completely healthy. For reasons we can't explain, we are losing her.
OBI-WAN	She's dying?
MEDICAL DROID	We don't know why. She has lost the will to live. We need to operate quickly if we are to save the babies.
BAIL ORGANA	Babies??!!
MEDICAL DROID	She's carrying twins.
YODA	Save them, we must. They are our last hope.
C-3PO	It s some kind of reproductive process, I think.
===	===
YODA	Pregnant, she must still appear. Hidden, safe, the children must be kept.
OBI-WAN	We must take them somewhere the Sith will not sense their presence.
YODA	Split up, they should be.
BAIL ORGANA	My wife and I will take the girl. We've always talked of adopting a baby girl. She will be loved with us.
OBI-WAN	And what of the boy?
YODA	To Tatooine. To his family, send him.
OBI-WAN	I will take the child and watch over him. Master Yoda, do you think Anakin's twins will be able to defeat Darth Sidious?
YODA	Strong the Force runs, in the Skywalker line. Hope, we can . . . Done, it is. Until the time is right, disappear we will. Master Kenobi, wait a moment. In your solitude on Tatooine, training I have for you.
OBI-WAN	Training??
YODA	An old friend has learned the path to immortality.
OBI-WAN	Who?
YODA	One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force to train me . . . your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.
OBI-WAN	Qui-Gon? But, how could he accomplish this?
YODA	The secret of the Ancient Order of the Whills, he studied. How to commune with him. I will teach you.
OBI-WAN	I will be able to talk with him?
YODA	How to join the Force, he will train you. Your consciousness you will retain, when one with the Force. Even your physical self, perhaps.
===	===
PALPATINE	I don't know how much longer I can hold off the vote, my friends. More and more star systems are joining the separatists.
MACE WINDU	If they do break away -
PALPATINE	No! I will not let that happen!
MACE WINDU	But if they do, you must realise there aren't enough Jedi to protect the Republic. We are keepers of the peace, not soldiers.
PALPATINE	Master Yoda, do you think it will really come to war?
YODA	Worse than war, I fear... Much worse.
PALPATINE	What?
MACE WINDU	What do you sense, Master?
YODA	Impossible to see ... The Dark Side clouds everything. But this I am sure of - Do their duty the Jedi will.
DAR WAC	The loyalist committee has arrived, my Lord.
PALPATINE	Send them in.
YODA	With you the force is strong... young Senator. To see you alive brings warm feeling to my heart.
PADME	Thank you, Master Yoda. Do you have any idea who was behind the attack?
MACE WINDU	Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners, on the moons of Naboo.
PADME	I don't wish to disagree but I think that Count Dooku was behind it.
MACE WINDU	You know, M'Lady, Count Dooku was once a Jedi. He wouldn't assassinate anyone, it is not in his character.
KI-ADI-MUNDI	He is a political idealist, not a murderer.
YODA	In dark times nothing is what it appears to be, but the fact remains Senator, in grave danger you are.
PALPATINE	Count Dooku has always avoided any kind of conflict. It appears he has no desire to start a war. Why would he kill you? To what end?
PADME	I don't know, but everything in my being tells me he was behind it...
PALPATINE	Master Jedi, may I suggest that the Senator be placed under the protection of your graces.
BAIL ORGANA	Do you think that is a wise use of manpower during these stressful times?
PADME	Chancellor, if I may comment, I do not believe the...
PALPATINE	"...""situation is that serious."" No, but I do, Senator."
PADME	Chancellor, please! I don't want any more guards!
PALPATINE	I realise all too well that additional security might be disruptive for you, but perhaps someone you are familiar with... an old friend like... Master Kenobi...
MACE WINDU	That's possible. He has just returned from a Border dispute on Ansion.
PALPATINE	You must remember him, M'Lady... he watched over you during the blockade conflict.
PADME	This is not necessary, Chancellor.
PALPATINE	Do it for me, M'Lady, please. I will rest easier. We had a big scare today. The thought of losing you is unbearable.
MACE WINDU	I will have Obi-Wan report to you immediately, M'Lady.
YODA	Too little about yourself you worry, Senator, and too much about politics. Be mindful of your danger, Padme. Accept our help.
PALPATINE	I will not like this Republiv, that has stood for over a thousand years, be split in two
===	===
MACE WINDU	Why couldn't we see this attack on the Senator?
YODA	Masking the future, is this disturbance in the Force.
MACE WINDU	The propecy is coming true, the Dark Side is growing.
YODA	And only those who have turned to the Dark Side can sense the possibilities of the future. Only going through the Dark Side can we see.
MACE WINDU	It's been ten years, and the Sith still have no shown themselves. Do you think they are behind this?
YODA	...Out there, they are. A certainty that is.
MACE WINDU	Do you think Obi-Wan's apprentice will be able to bring balance to the Force?
YODA	Only if he chooses to follow his destiny.
===	===
YODA	Don't think... feel... be as one with the Force. Help you, it will. Younglings - enough! A visitor we have. Welcome him. Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet the mighty Bear Clan.
CHILDREN	Welcome, Master Obi-Wan!
OBI-WAN	I am sorry to disturb you, Master.
YODA	What help to you, can I be?
OBI-WAN	I'm looking for a planet described to me by an old friend. I trust him. But the system doesn't show up on the archive maps.
YODA	An interesting puzzle. Gather round the map reader, younglings. Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet. Find it, we will try...
OBI-WAN	This is where it ought to be... but it isn't. Gravity is pulling all the stars in this area inward to this spot. There should be a star here... but there isn't.
YODA	Most interesting. Gravity's silhouette remains, but the star and all its planets have disappeared. How can this be?
JEDI CHILD JACK	Because someone erased it from the archive memory.
CHILDREN	That's right! Yes! That's what happened! Someone erased it!
JEDI CHILD MAY	If the planet blew up, the gravity would go away.
YODA	Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is. Uncluttered. To the centre of the pull of gravity go, and find your planet you will.
OBI-WAN	But Master Yoda who could have erased information from the archives? That's impossible, isn't it?
YODA	Much harder to answer, that question is.
===	===
MACE WINDU	Be wary, this disturbance in the Force is growing stronger.
OBI-WAN	I am concerned for my Padawan. He is not ready to be on his own.
YODA	The Council is confident in this decision, Obi-Wan.
MACE	He has exceptional skills. The Council is confident in its decision, Obi-Wan. If the prophecy is true, he weill be the one to bring balance to the Force.
OBI-WAN	But he still has much to learn. And his abilities have made him... well... arrogant. I realise now what you and Master Yoda knew from the beginning... the boy was too old to start the training and...
MACE WINDU	There's something else?
OBI-WAN	Master, he should not have been given this assignment. I'm afraid Anakin won't be able to protect the Senator.
MACE WINDU	Why?
OBI-WAN	He has a... an emotional connection with her. It's been there since he was boy. Now he's confused... distracted.
MACE-WINDU	Obi-Wan, you must have faith that he will take the right path.
OBI-WAN	Has Master Yoda gained any insight into whether or not this war will come about?
MACE WINDU	Probing the Dark Side is a dangerous process. He could be in seclusion for days... May the force be with you.
===	===
OBI-WAN	...I've never heard of a Jedi called Sido-Dyas, have you, Master?
MACE WINDU	No. Whoever placed that order was not a Jedi, I can assure you.
OBI-WAN	I have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter is the assassin we're looking for.
YODA	Who he is working for... discover that, you must.
OBI-WAN	I will, Master, and I will also find out more about this clone army... May The Force...
WINDU	A clone army! Ordered by someone in the Senate perhaps... Someone's out to start a war.
YODA	Inform the chancellor of this, we must.
WINDU	Who do you think this impostor Sido-Dyas, could be?
===	===
OBI-WAN	...Starships from the Trade Federation and the Commerce Guilds are taking deliveries of battle droids from the foundries on Geonosis.
BAIL ORGANA	That's outrageous! The treaty forbids the Trade Federation from building up an army. What are they doing?!
OBI-WAN	The droid foundry seems to be working at full capacity. I am going to go down and investigate. I will bring Jango Fett back home for interrogation.
PALPATINE	Those Geonosian foundries are part of the Techno Union. We will call in their representatives and ask them a few very pointed questions.
OBI-WAN	One more thing. Jango mentioned he was recruited by someone named Darth Tyranus. Any idea who that might be?
YODA	With the forename Darth, a Sith he must be.
MACE WINDU	Our missing apprentice. They are playing their hand at last.
OBI-WAN	Do you believe he could be the mysterious Sido-Dyas, who made the deal for the clone army?
YODA	Perhaps too many pieces are missing from this puzzle, there are.
MACE WINDU	Be careful, Obi-Wan. This investigation is becoming less than routine. Do you need help?
OBI-WAN	Let me see if I can figure out what's going on first.
BAIL ORGANA	The Commerce Guilds are preparing for war... there can be no doubt of that.
PALPATINE	Count Dooku must have made a treaty with them.
MACE WINDU	We must stop them soon before they're fully ready.
SENATOR ASK AAK	The debate is over, we need that clone army now!
BAIL ORGANA	Unfortunately, the debate is not over. The Senate will never be able to approve the use of that army before the separatists attack.
MAS AMEDDA	This is a crisis! If the Senate votes the Chancellor emergency powers, he could approve the use of the army in a minute.
PALPATINE	Please, please, I don't wish to have emergency powers. That's too extreme a solution. It's akin to a dictatorship. We must rely on the Jedi. Master Yoda, how many are available to go to Geonosis?
YODA	Two Hundred,... less or more.
BAIL ORGANA	With all due respect for the Jedi Order, two hundred will be no match for hundreds of thousands of battle droids.
MACE WINDU	Patience. We should wait for Obi- Wan to report back. We don't know that Count Dooku has made a treaty with the Corporate Alliance, it's speculation.
SENATOR ASK AAK	But we must prepare for the worst. I'm going to propose a motion granting emergency powers to the Chancellor at the next session. We must not wait!
PALPATINE	Out of the question, Senator! You and I are too closely aligned. The issue will become partisan and debates will begin. The proposal must come from a neutral source.
MAS AMEDDA	If only Senator Amidala were here.
JAR JAR	Supreme Chancellor... my august colleagues, I would be proud to propose the motion in question. This is a grave situation, and I'm sure Senator Amidala, and the Queen of Naboo would agree.
SENATOR ASK AAK	Thank you, Representative Binks.
PALPATINE	If called upon, I will serve. But it will be the saddest day of my life.
===	===
MACE WINDU	The longer we wait, the stronger Dooku's armies become. We cannot wait for the Senate to make up its mind about granting the Chancellor emergency powers, in order to be able to use that clone army... We have the authority to go now. We must go now.
YODA	Agreed, Master Windu. Two hundred Jedi send. Enough, let's hope they are.
===	===
COUNT DOOKU	Master Windu! You have fought gallantly. Worthy of recognition in the history archives of the Jedi Order. Now it is finished. Surrender - and your lives will be spared.
MACE WINDU	We will not be hostages for you to barter with Dooku.
COUNT DOOKU	Then, I'm sorry, old friend. You will have to be destroyed.
PADME	Look!
YODA	Come on - hurry! Hurry!
===	===
YODA	More battalions to the left. Encircle them we must, then divide.
===	===
DROID CAPTAIN	Your Excellency!
COUNT DOOKU	That won't be necessary, Captain. Stand down. And leave them to me.
OBI-WAN	We move in together - you slowly on the...
ANAKIN	I'm taking him now!
OBI-WAN	Anakin, no!
ANAKIN	You'll pay for all the Jedi you've killed today, Dooku.
COUNT DOOKU	Kenobi, isn't it? As you can see, my Jedi powers are far beyond yours. Now, back down.
OBI-WAN	I don't think so.
COUNT DOOKU	Ah, but if I must. I have spent the last ten years learning to use the power of the Dark Side. It gives me infinitely greater power.
OBI-WAN	You will have to prove it.
COUNT DOOKU	Grand Master Kenobi, you disappoint me. Yoda holds you in such high esteem. Surely you can do better...? No, I'm surprised. Has Jedi swordsmanship degenerated so quickly, or are you trying to make fun of me? Which is it? come, come, Master Kenobi. Put me out of my misery. That's brave of you, boy - but foolish. I would have thought you'd have learnt your lesson.
ANAKIN	I'm a slow learner.
COUNT DOOKU	You have unusual powers, young Padawan. But not enought to save you this time.
ANAKIN	Don't bet on it!
OBI-WAN	Anakin!
COUNT DOOKU	Master Yoda. At last we shall know who is the most powerful.
YODA	Count Dooku. No interest in contests, do I have. The end for you, Count, this is.
COUNT DOOKU	...Not yet...
PADME	Anakin!
CLONE CAPTAIN	Resistance is at an end, General. What are your orders ?
===	===
MACE WINDU	Where is your apprentice?
OBI-WAN	On his way back to Naboo. He is escorting Senator Amidala home. I must admit without the clones, it would not have been a victory.
YODA	Victory? Victory, you say? Not victory, a defeat, it was... Master Obi-Wan. Begun, the Clone War has!
===	===
YODA	Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?
LUKE	No... of course not.
YODA	I do, yes, I do!  Sick have I become. Old and weak. (Points a crooked finger) When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm? Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have.
LUKE	Master Yoda, you can't die.
YODA	Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things ... the way of the Force.
LUKE	But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
YODA	No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
LUKE	Then I am a Jedi?
YODA	Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.
LUKE	Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?
YODA	Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.
LUKE	Yoda, I must know.
YODA	Your father he is. Told you, did he?
LUKE	Yes.
YODA	Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
LUKE	Unfortunate that I know the truth?
YODA	No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you.
LUKE	Well, I'm sorry.
YODA	Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I (cough), the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... (with great effort) There is... another...Sky...Sky...walker.
===	===
LUKE	Ready for some power? Okay. Let's see now. Put that in there. There you go. Now all I have to do is find this Yoda...if he even exists. Still...there's something familiar about this place. I feel like...I don't know...
STRANGE VOICE	Feel like what?
LUKE	Like we're being watched!
YODA	Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm. I am wondering, why are you here?
LUKE	I'm looking for someone.
YODA	Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm?
LUKE	Right.
YODA	Help you I can. Yes, mmmm.
LUKE	I don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior.
YODA	Ahhh! A great warrior.  Wars not make one great.
LUKE	Put that down. Hey! That's my dinner.
YODA	How you get so big, eating food of this kind?
LUKE	Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just...
YODA	Aww, cannot get your ship out?
LUKE	Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh...you're making a mess. Hey, give me that!
YODA	Mine! Or I will help you not.
LUKE	I don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole.
YODA	Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is. Ah, ah, ah!
LUKE	Oh, Artoo, let him have it.
YODA	Mine! Mine!
LUKE	Artoo!
YODA	Mine!
LUKE	Now will you move along, little fella? We're got a lot of work to do.
YODA	No! No, no! Stay and help you, I will.  Find your friend, hmm?
LUKE	I'm not looking for a friend, I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
YODA	Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda.
LUKE	You know him?
YODA	Mmm. Take you to him, I will.  Yes, yes. But now, we must eat. Come. Good food. Come. Come, come.
LUKE	Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo.
===	===
LUKE	Look, I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we can't see Yoda now.
YODA	Patience! For the Jedi it is time to eat as well. Eat, eat. Hot. Good food, hm? Good, hmm?
LUKE	How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there?
YODA	Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him. (tasting food from the pot) Rootleaf, I cook. Why wish you become Jedi? Hm?
LUKE	Mostly because of my father, I guess.
YODA	Ah, your father. Powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi, mmm.
LUKE	Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am. (fed up) Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time.
YODA	I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience.
OBI-WAN	He will learn patience.
YODA	Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father.
OBI-WAN	Was I any different when you taught me?
YODA	Hah. He is not ready.
LUKE	Yoda! I am ready. I...Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm ready.
YODA	Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. (to the invisible Ben, indicating Luke) This one a long time have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. (turning to Luke) You are reckless!
OBI-WAN	So was I, if you'll remember.
YODA	He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training.
LUKE	But I've learned so much.
YODA	Will he finished what he begins?
LUKE	I won't fail you -- I'm not afraid.
YODA	Oh, you will be. You will be.
===	===
YODA	Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger...fear...aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.
LUKE	Vader. Is the dark side stronger?
YODA	No...no...no. Quicker, easier, more seductive.
LUKE	But how am I to know the good side from the bad?
YODA	You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.
LUKE	But tell me why I can't...
YODA	No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmm.
LUKE	There's something not right here. I feel cold, death.
YODA	That place...is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go.
LUKE	What's in there?
YODA	Only what you take with you. Your weapons...you will not need them.
===	===
YODA	Use the Force. Yes... Now...the stone. Feel it. Concentrate!
LUKE	Oh, no. We'll never get it out now.
YODA	So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say?
LUKE	Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally different.
YODA	No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned.
LUKE	All right, I'll give it a try.
YODA	No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.
LUKE	I can't. It's too big.
YODA	Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm? Mmmm. And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It's energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we...(Yoda pinches Luke's shoulder)...not this crude matter. (a sweeping gesture) You must feel the Force around you. (gesturing) Here, between you...me...the tree...the rock...everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship!
LUKE	You want the impossible. I don't...I don't believe it.
YODA	That is why you fail.
===	===
YODA	Concentrate...feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm, yes. Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future...the past. Old friends long gone.
LUKE	Han! Leia!
YODA	Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control.
LUKE	I saw...I saw a city in the clouds.
YODA	Mmm. Friends you have there.
LUKE	They were in pain.
YODA	It is the future you see.
LUKE	Future? Will they die?
YODA	Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.
LUKE	I've got to go to them.
YODA	Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.
===	===
YODA	Luke! You must complete the training.
LUKE	I can't keep the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I've got to help them.
YODA	You must not go!
LUKE	But Han and Leia will die if I don't.
OBI-WAN	You don't know that. Even Yoda cannot see their fate.
LUKE	But I can help them! I feel the Force!
OBI-WAN	But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force.
YODA	Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure at the cave!
LUKE	But I've learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to return and finish what I've begun. You have my word.
OBI-WAN	It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. that is why your friends are made to suffer.
LUKE	And that is why I have to go.
OBI-WAN	Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost Vader.
LUKE	You won't.
YODA	Stopped they must be. On this depends. Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil.
OBI-WAN	Patience.
LUKE	And sacrifice Han and Leia?
YODA	If you honor what they fight for...yes!
OBI-WAN	If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot interfere.
LUKE	I understand.  Artoo, fire up the converters.
OBI-WAN	Luke, don't give in to hate -- that leads to the dark side.
YODA	Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.
LUKE	I will. And I'll return. I promise.
YODA	Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse.
OBI-WAN	That boy is our last hope.
YODA	No. There is another.
