ANAKIN	They are of pain, suffering, death . . .
YODA	Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?
ANAKIN	Someone . . .
YODA	. . . close to you?
ANAKIN	Yes.
YODA	Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.
ANAKIN	I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda.
YODA	Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.
ANAKIN	What must I do, Master Yoda?
YODA	Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.
===	===
ANAKIN	I will do my best to uphold the principles of the Jedi Order.
YODA	Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.
KI-ADI-MUNDI	We have surveyed all systems in the Republic, and have found no sign of General Grievous.
YODA	Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep.
OBI-WAN	And yet, it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup.
YODA	Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait.
MACE	Skywalker, your assignment is here with the Chancellor, and Kenobi must find General Grievous.
YODA	Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.
===	===
OBI-WAN	Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.
YODA	Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.
MACE	So the prophecy says.
YODA	A prophecy . . . that misread could have been.
OBI-WAN	He will not let me down. He never has.
YODA	I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you.
===	===
ANAKIN	A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.
YODA	Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.
KI-ADI-MUNDI	Yes, this decision is ours to make.
YODA	A Master is needed, with more experience.
OBI-WAN	Oh no, you're quite right, but I do have the most experience with his ways of combat.
YODA	Obi-Wan, my choice is.
KI-ADI-MUNDI	I concur. Master Kenobi should go.
YODA	I agree.
===	===
CLONE COMMANDER GREE	The droids have started up their main power generators.
YODA	Then now the time is, Commander.
===	===
KI-ADI-MUNDI	. . . and replace the Congress with Senators who are not filled with greed and corruption.
YODA	To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmmmmm. . . . great care we must take.
===	===
AT-ST CLONE SERGEANT	Everyone out of there!
YODA	Wookiee good . . . eat Wookiee.
CLONE SERGEANT	Did you find something?
YODA	It's nothing, nothing.
CLONE TROOPER	Yes, sir.
YODA	Right you are, Chewbacca. Faster that will be. Stink, this mud does. A moment to bathe, give me. Not far, are we, from the emergency ship. Quickly . . .
===	===
BAIL ORGANA	You made it.
YODA	Master Kenobi, dark times are these. Good to see you. it is.
OBI-WAN	You were attacked by your Clones, also?
YODA	With the help of the Wookiees, barely escape, I did.
OBI-WAN	How many other Jedi managed to survive?
YODA	Heard from no one, have we.
OBI-WAN	Have we had any contact from the Temple?
YODA	Received a coded retreat message, we have.
BAIL ORGANA	It's too dangerous to return.
YODA	Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?
OBI-WAN	Yes, Master. There is too much at stake here, and we need a clearer picture of what has happened.
YODA	I agree. In a dark place we find ourselves ... a little more knowledge might light our way.
===	===
OBI-WAN	No, I don't think so. The Chancellor will not be able to control the thousands of star systems without keeping the Senate intact.
YODA	If a special session of Congress there is, easier for us to enter the Jedi Temple it will be.
===	===
OBI-WAN	There are several battalions of Clone Troopers on every level. Many are dressed as Jedi.
YODA	Dismantle the coded signal quickly. That group back there, soon discovered will be.
===	===
OBI-WAN	Not even the younglings survived.
YODA	Killed not by clones, this Padawan. By a lightsaber, he was.
===	===
OBI-WAN	I've recalibrated the code warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.
YODA	Good . . . For the Clones to discover the recalibration, a long time it will take. To change it back, longer still. Hurry.
===	===
OBI-WAN	Wait, Master. There is something I must know . . .
YODA	If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.
OBI-WAN	I can't watch any more.
YODA	Destroy the Sith, we must.
OBI-WAN	Send me to kill the Emperor. I will not kill Anakin.
YODA	To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not.
OBI-WAN	He is like my brother ... I cannot do it.
YODA	Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has become. The boy you trained, gone he is . . . Consumed by Darth Vader.
OBI-WAN	How could it have come to this?
YODA	To question, no time there is.
OBI-WAN	I do not know where the Emperor has sent him. I don't know where to look.
YODA	Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him, you will. Visit the new Emperor, my task is. May the Force be with you.
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	Master Yoda, you survived.
YODA	Surprised?
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	I have waited a long time for this moment, my little green friend. At last, the Jedi are no more.
YODA	Not if anything I have to say about it, Lord Sidious. At an end your rule is and not short enough it was, I must say. If so powerful you are, why leave??
DARTH SIDIOUS	You will not stop me. Darth Vader will become more powerful than either of us.
YODA	Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be, as is your faith in the dark side of the Force.
===	===
QUI-GON	Patience. You will have time. I did not. When I became one with the Force I made a great discovery. With my training, you will be able to merge with the Force at will. Your physical self will fade away, but you will still retain your consciousness. You will become more powerful than any Sith.
YODA	Eternal consciousness.
QUI-GON	The ability to defy oblivion can be achieved, but only for oneself. It was accomplished by a Shaman of the Whills. It is a state acquired through compassion, not greed.
YODA	. . . to become one with the Force, and influence still have . . . A power greater than all, it is.
QUI-GON	You will learn to let go of everything. No attachment, no thought of self. No physical self.
YODA	A great Jedi Master, you have become, Qui-Gon Jinn. Your apprentice I gratefully become.
===	===
MEDICAL DROID	She's carrying twins.
YODA	Save them, we must. They are our last hope.
===	===
OBI-WAN	We must take them somewhere the Sith will not sense their presence.
YODA	Split up, they should be.
OBI-WAN	And what of the boy?
YODA	To Tatooine. To his family, send him.
OBI-WAN	I will take the child and watch over him. Master Yoda, do you think Anakin's twins will be able to defeat Darth Sidious?
YODA	Strong the Force runs, in the Skywalker line. Hope, we can . . . Done, it is. Until the time is right, disappear we will. Master Kenobi, wait a moment. In your solitude on Tatooine, training I have for you.
OBI-WAN	Training??
YODA	An old friend has learned the path to immortality.
OBI-WAN	Who?
YODA	One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force to train me . . . your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.
OBI-WAN	Qui-Gon? But, how could he accomplish this?
YODA	The secret of the Ancient Order of the Whills, he studied. How to commune with him. I will teach you.
OBI-WAN	I will be able to talk with him?
YODA	How to join the Force, he will train you. Your consciousness you will retain, when one with the Force. Even your physical self, perhaps.
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	Master Yoda, do you think it will really come to war?
YODA	Worse than war, I fear... Much worse.
MACE WINDU	What do you sense, Master?
YODA	Impossible to see ... The Dark Side clouds everything. But this I am sure of - Do their duty the Jedi will.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Send them in.
YODA	With you the force is strong... young Senator. To see you alive brings warm feeling to my heart.
KI-ADI-MUNDI	He is a political idealist, not a murderer.
YODA	In dark times nothing is what it appears to be, but the fact remains Senator, in grave danger you are.
MACE WINDU	I will have Obi-Wan report to you immediately, M'Lady.
YODA	Too little about yourself you worry, Senator, and too much about politics. Be mindful of your danger, Padme. Accept our help.
===	===
MACE WINDU	Why couldn't we see this attack on the Senator?
YODA	Masking the future, is this disturbance in the Force.
MACE WINDU	The propecy is coming true, the Dark Side is growing.
YODA	And only those who have turned to the Dark Side can sense the possibilities of the future. Only going through the Dark Side can we see.
MACE WINDU	It's been ten years, and the Sith still have no shown themselves. Do you think they are behind this?
YODA	...Out there, they are. A certainty that is.
MACE WINDU	Do you think Obi-Wan's apprentice will be able to bring balance to the Force?
YODA	Only if he chooses to follow his destiny.
===	===
OBI-WAN	I am sorry to disturb you, Master.
YODA	What help to you, can I be?
OBI-WAN	I'm looking for a planet described to me by an old friend. I trust him. But the system doesn't show up on the archive maps.
YODA	An interesting puzzle. Gather round the map reader, younglings. Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet. Find it, we will try...
OBI-WAN	This is where it ought to be... but it isn't. Gravity is pulling all the stars in this area inward to this spot. There should be a star here... but there isn't.
YODA	Most interesting. Gravity's silhouette remains, but the star and all its planets have disappeared. How can this be?
JEDI CHILD MAY	If the planet blew up, the gravity would go away.
YODA	Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is. Uncluttered. To the centre of the pull of gravity go, and find your planet you will.
OBI-WAN	But Master Yoda who could have erased information from the archives? That's impossible, isn't it?
YODA	Much harder to answer, that question is.
===	===
OBI-WAN	I am concerned for my Padawan. He is not ready to be on his own.
YODA	The Council is confident in this decision, Obi-Wan.
===	===
OBI-WAN	I have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter is the assassin we're looking for.
YODA	Who he is working for... discover that, you must.
WINDU	A clone army! Ordered by someone in the Senate perhaps... Someone's out to start a war.
YODA	Inform the chancellor of this, we must.
===	===
OBI-WAN	One more thing. Jango mentioned he was recruited by someone named Darth Tyranus. Any idea who that might be?
YODA	With the forename Darth, a Sith he must be.
OBI-WAN	Do you believe he could be the mysterious Sido-Dyas, who made the deal for the clone army?
YODA	Perhaps too many pieces are missing from this puzzle, there are.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Please, please, I don't wish to have emergency powers. That's too extreme a solution. It's akin to a dictatorship. We must rely on the Jedi. Master Yoda, how many are available to go to Geonosis?
YODA	Two Hundred,... less or more.
===	===
MACE WINDU	The longer we wait, the stronger Dooku's armies become. We cannot wait for the Senate to make up its mind about granting the Chancellor emergency powers, in order to be able to use that clone army... We have the authority to go now. We must go now.
YODA	Agreed, Master Windu. Two hundred Jedi send. Enough, let's hope they are.
===	===
PADME	Look!
YODA	Come on - hurry! Hurry!
===	===
COUNT DOOKU	Master Yoda. At last we shall know who is the most powerful.
YODA	Count Dooku. No interest in contests, do I have. The end for you, Count, this is.
===	===
OBI-WAN	On his way back to Naboo. He is escorting Senator Amidala home. I must admit without the clones, it would not have been a victory.
YODA	Victory? Victory, you say? Not victory, a defeat, it was... Master Obi-Wan. Begun, the Clone War has!
===	===
LUKE	No... of course not.
YODA	I do, yes, I do!  Sick have I become. Old and weak. (Points a crooked finger) When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm? Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have.
LUKE	Master Yoda, you can't die.
YODA	Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things ... the way of the Force.
LUKE	But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
YODA	No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
LUKE	Then I am a Jedi?
YODA	Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.
LUKE	Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?
YODA	Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.
LUKE	Yoda, I must know.
YODA	Your father he is. Told you, did he?
LUKE	Yes.
YODA	Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
LUKE	Unfortunate that I know the truth?
YODA	No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you.
LUKE	Well, I'm sorry.
YODA	Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I (cough), the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... (with great effort) There is... another...Sky...Sky...walker.
===	===
LUKE	Like we're being watched!
YODA	Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm. I am wondering, why are you here?
LUKE	I'm looking for someone.
YODA	Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm?
LUKE	Right.
YODA	Help you I can. Yes, mmmm.
LUKE	I don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior.
YODA	Ahhh! A great warrior.  Wars not make one great.
LUKE	Put that down. Hey! That's my dinner.
YODA	How you get so big, eating food of this kind?
LUKE	Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just...
YODA	Aww, cannot get your ship out?
LUKE	Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh...you're making a mess. Hey, give me that!
YODA	Mine! Or I will help you not.
LUKE	I don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole.
YODA	Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is. Ah, ah, ah!
LUKE	Oh, Artoo, let him have it.
YODA	Mine! Mine!
LUKE	Artoo!
YODA	Mine!
LUKE	Now will you move along, little fella? We're got a lot of work to do.
YODA	No! No, no! Stay and help you, I will.  Find your friend, hmm?
LUKE	I'm not looking for a friend, I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
YODA	Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda.
LUKE	You know him?
YODA	Mmm. Take you to him, I will.  Yes, yes. But now, we must eat. Come. Good food. Come. Come, come.
===	===
LUKE	Look, I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we can't see Yoda now.
YODA	Patience! For the Jedi it is time to eat as well. Eat, eat. Hot. Good food, hm? Good, hmm?
LUKE	How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there?
YODA	Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him. (tasting food from the pot) Rootleaf, I cook. Why wish you become Jedi? Hm?
LUKE	Mostly because of my father, I guess.
YODA	Ah, your father. Powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi, mmm.
LUKE	Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am. (fed up) Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time.
YODA	I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience.
OBI-WAN	He will learn patience.
YODA	Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father.
OBI-WAN	Was I any different when you taught me?
YODA	Hah. He is not ready.
LUKE	Yoda! I am ready. I...Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm ready.
YODA	Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. (to the invisible Ben, indicating Luke) This one a long time have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. (turning to Luke) You are reckless!
OBI-WAN	So was I, if you'll remember.
YODA	He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training.
LUKE	But I've learned so much.
YODA	Will he finished what he begins?
LUKE	I won't fail you -- I'm not afraid.
YODA	Oh, you will be. You will be.
===	===
LUKE	Vader. Is the dark side stronger?
YODA	No...no...no. Quicker, easier, more seductive.
LUKE	But how am I to know the good side from the bad?
YODA	You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.
LUKE	But tell me why I can't...
YODA	No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmm.
LUKE	There's something not right here. I feel cold, death.
YODA	That place...is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go.
LUKE	What's in there?
YODA	Only what you take with you. Your weapons...you will not need them.
===	===
LUKE	Oh, no. We'll never get it out now.
YODA	So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say?
LUKE	Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally different.
YODA	No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned.
LUKE	All right, I'll give it a try.
YODA	No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.
LUKE	I can't. It's too big.
YODA	Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm? Mmmm. And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It's energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we...(Yoda pinches Luke's shoulder)...not this crude matter. (a sweeping gesture) You must feel the Force around you. (gesturing) Here, between you...me...the tree...the rock...everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship!
LUKE	You want the impossible. I don't...I don't believe it.
YODA	That is why you fail.
===	===
LUKE	Han! Leia!
YODA	Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control.
LUKE	I saw...I saw a city in the clouds.
YODA	Mmm. Friends you have there.
LUKE	They were in pain.
YODA	It is the future you see.
LUKE	Future? Will they die?
YODA	Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.
LUKE	I've got to go to them.
YODA	Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.
===	===
LUKE	I can't keep the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I've got to help them.
YODA	You must not go!
OBI-WAN	But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force.
YODA	Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure at the cave!
LUKE	You won't.
YODA	Stopped they must be. On this depends. Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil.
LUKE	And sacrifice Han and Leia?
YODA	If you honor what they fight for...yes!
OBI-WAN	Luke, don't give in to hate -- that leads to the dark side.
YODA	Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.
LUKE	I will. And I'll return. I promise.
YODA	Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse.
OBI-WAN	That boy is our last hope.
YODA	No. There is another.
===	===
