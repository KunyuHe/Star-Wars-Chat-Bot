ANAKIN	Are you coming, Master?
OBI-WAN	Oh no. I'm not brave enough for politics. I have to report to the Council. Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy.
ANAKIN	Hold on, this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time.
OBI-WAN	Sorry, old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor, carrying me unconscious on your back, and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely . . .
ANAKIN	All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness.
OBI-WAN	. . . the endless speeches . . . Anakin, let's be fair. Today, you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.
ANAKIN	All right. But you owe me . . . and not for saving your skin for the tenth time . . .
OBI-WAN	Ninth time . . . that business on Cato Nemoidia doesn't count. I'll see you at the briefing.
MACE WINDU	Chancellor Palpatine, what a welcome sight! Are you all right?
PALPATINE	Yes, thanks to your two Jedi Knights. They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again.
MACE WINDU	General Grievous will run and hide as he always does. He is a coward.
PALPATINE	That maybe true, but with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the Droid Army, and I assure you, the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.
MACE WINDU	Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority.
BAIL ORGANA	Skywalker, the Republic cannot praise you enough.
ANAKIN	Thank you, Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the Separatists, but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to take advantage of.
C-3PO	It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that. Well, there, I agree with you. In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.
===	===
PADME	Thank you, Captain.
CAPTAIN TYPHO	Rest well. My Lady.
PADME	I'll be up in a while.
MOTEE	Yes, my lady.
C-3PO	Is there anything I might do for you, my lady?
PADME	Yes, make sure all the security droids are working. Thank you, Threepio.
ANAKIN	Beautiful, isn't it?
PADME	You startled me.
ANAKIN	How are you feeling?
PADME	He keeps kicking.
ANAKIN	He?! Why do you think it's a boy?
PADME	My motherly intuition.
ANAKIN	Whoa! With a kick that strong, it's got to be a girl.
PADME	I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I'm so proud of you.
ANAKIN	I may be on the Council, but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master.
PADME	Patience. In time, they will recognize your skills.
ANAKIN	They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power, that's the problem.
PADME	Anakin . . .
ANAKIN	Sometimes, I wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.
PADME	Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?
ANAKIN	What do you mean?
PADME	What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?
ANAKIN	I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a Separatist!
PADME	Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.
ANAKIN	Don't ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I'm not your errand boy. I'm not anyone's errand boy!
PADME	What is it?
ANAKIN	Nothing.
PADME	Don't do this . . . don't shut me out. Let me help you.
ANAKIN	You can't help me . . . I'm trying to help you. I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me.
PADME	I sense there are things you are not telling me. Hold me . . . like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long ago . . . when there was nothing but our love ... No politics, no plotting ... no war.
===	===
PALPATINE	You do know, don't you, if the Jedi destroy me, any chance of saving her will be lost.
PADME	I truly, deeply love you. Before I die. I want you to know.
C-3PO	My Lady, are you. . . . Are you all right?
ANAKIN	I can't do this ... I can't let her die.
===	===
C-3PO	The Chancellor's office indicated Master Anakin returned to the Jedi Temple. Don't worry, My Lady. I am sure he will be all right.
===	===
C-3PO	My Lady, there's a Jedi fighter docking on the veranda.
===	===
C-3PO	Hush! Not so loud!
PADME	Are you all right? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi Temple . . . you can see the smoke from here.
ANAKIN	I'm fine. I'm fine. I came to see if you and the baby are safe.
PADME	Captain Typho's here, we're safe. What's happening?
C-3PO	What is going on? You can't be anymore confused than I am.
ANAKIN	The situation is not good. The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic . . .
PADME	I can't believe that!
ANAKIN	I couldn't either at first, but it's true. I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the Chancellor myself.
C-3PO	Something important is going on! I heard a rumor they are going to banish all droids. Shhhhhh . . . not so loud. Whatever it is, we'll be the last to know.
PADME	Anakin, what are you going to do?
ANAKIN	I will not betray the Republic . . . my loyalties lie with the Chancellor and with the Senate . . . and with you.
PADME	What about Obi-Wan?
ANAKIN	I don't know . . . Many Jedi have been killed. We can only hope that he's remained loyal to the Chancellor.
PADME	How could this have happened?
ANAKIN	The Republic is unstable, Padme. The Jedi aren't the only ones trying to take advantage of the situation. There are also traitors in the Senate.
PADME	What are you saying?
ANAKIN	You need to distance yourself from your friends in the Senate. The Chancellor said they will be dealt with when this conflict is over.
PADME	What if they start an inquisition? I've opposed this war. What will you do if I become a suspect?
ANAKIN	That won't happen. I won't let it.
PADME	Oh, Anakin, I'm afraid.
ANAKIN	Have faith, my love. Everything will soon be set right. The Chancellor has given me a very important mission. The Separatists have gathered in the Mustafar system. I'm going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return . . . things will be different, I promise. Please, wait for me.
PADME	I will.
C-3PO	Well, he is under a lot of stress, Artoo. Take care, my little friend. My Lady, is there anything I might do?
PADME	No thank you, Threepio.
G-3PO	A snack, perhaps?
PADME	No.
C-3PO	I feel so helpless.
===	===
C-3PO	Hello, might I help you . . . Oh, it's you, Master Kenobi. Come in, quickly.
OBI-WAN	Has Anakin been here . . . ?
C-3PO	Yes . . . right after the attack on the Jedi Temple.
PADME	Master Kenobi . . . Oh, Obi-Wan, thank goodness . . . you're alive.
OBI-WAN	The Republic has fallen. Padme . . . The Jedi Order is no more . . .
PADME	I know, it's hard to believe everything to which we've dedicated our lives is gone.
OBI-WAN	I believe we have been part of a plot hundreds of years in the making.
PADME	The Senate is still intact, there is some hope.
OBI-WAN	No. Padme . . . It's over . . . The Sith now rule the galaxy as they did before the Republic.
PADME	The Sith!?!
OBI-WAN	I'm here looking for Anakin . . . When was the last time you saw him?
PADME	Yesterday.
OBI-WAN	And do you know where he is now?
PADME	No.
OBI-WAN	Padme, I need your help. He's in grave danger.
PADME	From the Sith?
OBI-WAN	From himself . . . Padme, Anakin has turned to the dark side.
PADME	You're wrong! How could you even say that?
OBI-WAN	I have seen a security hologram of him killing younglings.
PADME	Not Anakin! He couldn't!
OBI-WAN	He was deceived by a lie. We all were. It appears that the Chancellor is behind everything, including the war. Palpatine is the Sith Lord we've been looking for. After the death of Count Dooku, Anakin became his new apprentice.
PADME	I don't believe you ... I can't.
OBI-WAN	Padme, I must find him.
PADME	You're going to kill him, aren't you?
OBI-WAN	He has become a very great threat.
PADME	I can't . . .
OBI-WAN	Anakin is the father, isn't he? I'm so sorry.
===	===
CAPTAIN TYPHO	My Lady, let me come with you.
PADME	There is no danger. The fighting is over, and . . . this is personal.
CAPTAIN TYPHO	As you wish, My Lady . . . but I strongly disagree.
PADME	I'll be all right, Captain. This is something I must do myself. Besides, Threepio will look after me.
C-3PO	Oh, dear.
===	===
C-3PO	Green light. Do you know that I think I'm beginning to get the hang of this flying business.
===	===
C-3PO	What are you doing? You're going to hurt her. Wait!!
===	===
C-3PO	I am being careful. I've got a good hold on her, but . . . I'm worried about my back. I hope it's able to hold up under this weight.
===	===
C-3PO	Master Kenobi! We have Miss Padme on board. Please, please hurry. We should leave this dreadful place.
===	===
MEDICAL DROID	Medically, she is completely healthy. For reasons we can't explain, we are losing her.
OBI-WAN	She's dying?
MEDICAL DROID	We don't know why. She has lost the will to live. We need to operate quickly if we are to save the babies.
BAIL ORGANA	Babies??!!
MEDICAL DROID	She's carrying twins.
YODA	Save them, we must. They are our last hope.
C-3PO	It s some kind of reproductive process, I think.
===	===
BAIL ORGANA	Captain Antilles.
CAPTAIN ANTILLES	Yes, Your Highness.
BAIL ORGANA	I'm placing these droids in your care. Treat them well. Clean them up. Have the Protocol Droid's mind wiped.
C-3PO	Oh, no.
===	===
C-3PO	Good evening. May I help you?
ANAKIN	Threepio?
C-3PO	Oh, my... oh, my! Master Anakin! My goodness, I can hardly believe it! And this must be Miss Padme.
PADME	Hello, Threepio.
ANAKIN	I've come to see my mother.
C-3PO	Oh, dear! I'm so terribly sorry, Master Annie.
PADME	Threepio, what's happened?
C-3PO	I think we'd better go inside.
===	===
C-3PO	Master Lars - Master Owen! Somebody to see you!
ANAKIN	I'm Anakin Skywalker. I'm here looking for my mother.
OWEN	Owen Lars... I guess I'm your step-brother. This is my girlfriend, Beru.
BERU	Hello.
PADME	I'm Padme.
OWEN	I had a feeling you might show up some day.
ANAKIN	Is my mother here?
CLIEGG	No, she's not. Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife... Come on inside. We have a lot to talk about.
===	===
C-3PO	Please don't leave us, Miss Padme. These people need your help.
PADME	I'm not leaving, Threepio. I just can't sleep.
C-3PO	That's something I cannot relate to. As a Protocol Droid, I'm either active or inactive. There's no in-between.
PADME	I guess you're lucky.
C-3PO	Do you really think so..? I suppose I shouldn't expect...
PADME	You're not happy here?
C-3PO	Oh, I'm not unhappy... and my masters here ar so kind I wouldn't wish to trouuble them, it's just... being like this... well, it's embarrassing.
PADME	Being like what?
C-3PO	Naked. If you pardon the expression. You see, when Master Annie made me, he never quite found the time to give me any outer covering. It's so humiliating. How would you like it if you had to go around with all your circuits showing?
PADME	I guess I wouldn't like it at all.
C-3PO	Of course you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's simply not protocol.
PADME	Maybe we can do something about it.
C-3PO	I don't think so. Only Master Annie...
PADME	Why not? They seem to have a box of old coverings here.
C-3PO	Oh? How observant of you, Miss Padme. Of course, I'm just not mechanically minded... if you see what I mean.
PADME	Let's see, if we put this... here...
C-3PO	Ooooh! That's tickles.
PADME	You'll have to be quiet, Threepio. Hold still, please.
===	===
PADME	There!
C-3PO	Um. How do I look?
OWEN	Great! You look perfect.
C-3PO	Perfect? Oh, Miss Padme, I'm so happy! Oh, pardon me. Thank you. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
OWEN	Well, Padme, I think he should be yours from now on... I know that is what my Mom would want.
C-3PO	Oh, my!
BERU	Come topside, everybody! He's back! He's back!
===	===
ANAKIN	Hey, where are you going?
PADME	To find Obi-Wan.
ANAKIN	No! You're not!
PADME	Let go of me!
ANAKIN	I'm not letting you go out there. It's too dangerous.
PADME	What?!?
ANAKIN	It's my job to protect you. I said it's too dangerous. You're not going, and that's final!
PADME	Don't you give me orders, Annie! I'm a Senator of the Galactic Republic. You have no authority to contain me, restrain me, or direct me! You remember your place, young man. Now you can come along and protect me or stay here. It's up to you.
C-3PO	Yes, it is, Artoo. Most confusing. One moment they're generating a pleasant mutual attraction and the next, waves of violent hostility. Even though I'm programmed to understand them, I doubt if I ever shall.
===	===
C-3PO	Yes, it has been rather a long time. Do you suppose something's happened to them? Danger? Oh no, I shouldn't think so. It looks a very dull planet to me. They should be back shortly. Just stop worrying, Artoo.
===	===
C-3PO	I don't hear anything. You're scaring me! Stop imagining things!
===	===
C-3PO	I'm sure I heard something, this time. Didn't you? It's probably just a celebration
===	===
C-3PO	Did you hear that?  They've shut down the main reactor.  We'll be destroyed for sure.  This is madness! We're doomed! There'll be no escape for the Princess this time. What's that?
===	===
C-3PO	I should have known better than to trust the logic of a half-sized thermocapsulary dehousing assister...
===	===
C-3PO	Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? At last!  Where have you been? They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do?  We'll be sent to the spice mines of Kessel or smashed into who knows what! Wait a minute, where are you going?
===	===
C-3PO	Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure.. Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease!  Now come out before somebody sees you. Secret mission?  What plans?  What are you talking about?  I'm not getting in there! I'm going to regret this.
===	===
C-3PO	That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here. Are you sure this things safe?
===	===
C-3PO	How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how.  We seem to be made to suffer.  It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart.  My joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is. Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that way.  It's much too rocky.  This way is much easier. What makes you think there are settlements over there? Don't get technical with me. What mission?  What are you talking about?  I've had just about enough of you!  Go that way!  You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile! And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it. No more adventures.  I'm not going that way.
===	===
C-3PO	That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault!  He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better. Wait, what's that?  A transport! I'm saved! Over here!  Help!  Please, help!
===	===
C-3PO	Artoo-Detoo!  It's you!  It's you!
===	===
C-3PO	Wake up!  Wake up! We're doomed. Do you think they'll melt us down? Don't shoot!  Don't shoot!  Will this never end?
===	===
BERU	Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.
LUKE	It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him.
OWEN	I have no need for a protocol droid.
C-3PO	Sir - not in an environment such as this - that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...
OWEN	What I really need is a droid that understands the binary languages of moisture vaporators.
C-3PO	Vaporators!  Sir - My first job was programming binary load lifters ... very similar to your vaporators. You could say...
OWEN	Do you speak Bocce?
C-3PO	Of course I can, sir.  It's like a second language for me...  I'm as fluent in Bocce...
OWEN	All right; shut up! I'll take this one.
C-3PO	Shutting up, sir.
OWEN	Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you?  I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner.
LUKE	But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters...
OWEN	You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done.  Now, come on, get to it!
LUKE	All right, come on!  And the red one, come on.  Well, come on, Red, let's go. Uncle Owen...
OWEN	Yeah?
LUKE	This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look!
OWEN	Hey, what're you trying to push on us?
C-3PO	Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition.  A real bargain.
LUKE	Uncle Owen...
OWEN	Yeah?
LUKE	What about that one?
OWEN	What about that blue one?  We'll take that one.
LUKE	Yeah, take it away.
C-3PO	Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir.  He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before.  Here he comes.
LUKE	Okay, let's go.
C-3PO	Now, don't forget this!  Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity!
===	===
C-3PO	Thank the maker!  This oil bath is going to feel so good.  I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!
LUKE	It just isn't fair.  Oh, Biggs is right.  I'm never gonna get out of here!
C-3PO	Is there anything I might do to help?
LUKE	Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!
C-3PO	I don't think so, sir.  I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.  Not on this planet, anyways.  As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.
LUKE	Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.
C-3PO	I see, sir.
LUKE	Uh, you can call me Luke.
C-3PO	I see, sir Luke.
LUKE	Just Luke.
C-3PO	And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.
LUKE	Hello. You got a lot of carbon scoring here.  It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.
C-3PO	With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.
LUKE	You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?
C-3PO	That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.
LUKE	Have you been in many battles?
C-3PO	Several, I think.  Actually, there's not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.
LUKE	Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good.  Were you on a starcruiser or...
LEIA	Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.
LUKE	What's this?
C-3PO	What is what?!?  He asked you a question... What is that?
LEIA	Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.
C-3PO	Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction.  Old data. Pay it no mind.
LUKE	Who is she?  She's beautiful.
C-3PO	I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
LEIA	Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...
C-3PO	I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.  A person of some importance, sir - I believe.  Our captain was attached to...
LUKE	Is there more to this recording?
C-3PO	Behave yourself, Artoo.  You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him.  He's our new master. He says he's the property of Obi- Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts.  And it's a private message for him.  Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what he's talking about.  Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.
LUKE	Obi-Wan Kenobi?  I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?
C-3PO	I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?
LUKE	Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea.  He's kind of a strange old hermit. I wonder who she is.  It sounds like she's in trouble.  I'd better play back the whole thing.
C-3PO	He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system.  He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.
LUKE	H'm?  Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off!  Okay. There you go. Well, wait a minute.  Where'd she go?  Bring her back!  Play back the entire message.
C-3PO	What message?  The one youÕve just been playing.  The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards!
AUNT BERU	Luke?  Luke!  Come to dinner!
LUKE	All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.
C-3PO	I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.
LUKE	Well, see what you can do with him.  I'll be right back.
C-3PO	Just you reconsider playing that message for him. No, I don't think he likes you at all. No, I don't like you either.
===	===
LUKE	What are you doing hiding there?
C-3PO	It wasn't my fault, sir.  Please don't deactivate me.  I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.
LUKE	Oh, no!
===	===
C-3PO	That R2 unit has always been a problem.  These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand.  Even I can't understand their logic at times.
LUKE	How could I be so stupid?  He's nowhere in sight.  Blast it!
C-3PO	Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?
LUKE	It's too dangerous with all the Sand People around.  We'll have to wait until morning.
OWEN	Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night.
LUKE	All right, I'll be there in a few minutes.  Boy, am I gonna get it. You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.
C-3PO	Oh, he excels at that, sir.
===	===
LUKE	How's that. Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far.  We must have missed him.  Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well.
C-3PO	Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault.
LUKE	Sure.  He needs you.  He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...
C-3PO	Deactivate!  Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt...
LUKE	Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner.  It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator.
===	===
LUKE	Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?
C-3PO	Master Luke here is your rightful owner.  We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me of your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.
LUKE	Well, come on. It's getting late. I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up.
C-3PO	If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop.
LUKE	No, he's not going to try anything. What's wrong with him now?
C-3PO	Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.
LUKE	Sand People!  Or worse!  Come on, let's have a look.  Come on.
===	===
C-3PO	Where am I?  I must have taken a bad step...
LUKE	Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before the Sand People return.
C-3PO	I don't think I can make it.  You go on, Master Luke.  There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
LUKE	No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that?
OBI-WAN	Quickly, son... they're on the move.
===	===
LUKE	No, my father didn't fight in the wars.  He was a navigator on a spice freighter.
OBI-WAN	That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals.  Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.
LUKE	You fought in the Clone Wars?
OBI-WAN	Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.
LUKE	I wish I'd known him.
OBI-WAN	He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.  And he was a good friend.  Which reminds me... I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.
C-3PO	Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile.
LUKE	Sure, go ahead. What is it?
OBI-WAN	Your fathers lightsaber.  This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster. An elegant weapon for a more civilized time.  For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.  Before the dark times, before the Empire.
LUKE	How did my father die?
OBI-WAN	A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.  He betrayed and murdered your father.  Now the Jedi are all but extinct.  Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.
LUKE	The Force?
OBI-WAN	Well, the Force is what gives the Jedi his power.  It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend.  And where you come from.
LUKE	I saw part of the message he was...
OBI-WAN	I seem to have found it.
LEIA	General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.  Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.  I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.  I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit.  My father will know how to retrieve it.  You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.  This is our most desperate hour.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.
OBI-WAN	You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.
LUKE	Alderaan?  I'm not going to Alderaan.  I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.
OBI-WAN	I need your help, Luke.  I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. She needs your help.
LUKE	I can't get involved!  I've got work to do!  It's not that I like the Empire.  I hate it!  But there's nothing I can do about it right now.  It's such a long way from here.
OBI-WAN	That's your uncle talking.
LUKE	Oh, God, my uncle.  How am I ever going to explain this?
OBI-WAN	Learn about the Force, Luke.
LUKE	Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.  You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
OBI-WAN	You must do what you feel is right, of course.
===	===
C-3PO	I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures.
LUKE	Go on, go on.  I can't understand how we got by those troopers.  I thought we were dead.
OBI-WAN	The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.  You will find it a powerful ally.
LUKE	Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?
OBI-WAN	Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here.  Only watch your step.  This place can be a little rough.
LUKE	I'm ready for anything.
C-3PO	Come along, Artoo.
===	===
BARTENDER	We don't serve their kind here!
LUKE	What?
BARTENDER	Your droids. They'll have to wait outside.  We don't want them here.
LUKE	Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder.  We don't want any trouble.
C-3PO	I heartily agree with you sir.
CREATURE	Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?
HUMAN	He doesn't like you.
LUKE	I'm sorry.
HUMAN	I don't like you either Don't insult us.  You just watch yourself.  We're wanted men.  I have the death sentence on twelve systems.
LUKE	I'll be careful than.
HUMAN	You'll be dead.
OBI-WAN	This little one isn't worth the effort.  Come let me buy you something...
BARTENDER	No blasters!  No blaster!
OBI-WAN	This is Chewbacca.  He's first- mate on a ship that might suit our needs.
===	===
C-3PO	I don't like the look of this.
===	===
C-3PO	Lock the door, Artoo.
TROOPER	All right, check that side of the street.  It's secure.  Move on to the next door.
C-3PO	I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you.  I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault. You watch your language!
===	===
C-3PO	Hello, sir.
===	===
HAN	Chewie, get us out of here!
C-3PO	Oh, my.  I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.
===	===
LUKE	Are you all right?  What's wrong?
OBI-WAN	I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.  I fear something terrible has happened. You'd better get on with your exercises.
HAN	Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.  I told you I'd outrun 'em. Don't everyone thank me at once. Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.
C-3PO	Now be careful, Artoo. He made a fair move.  Screaming about it won't help you.
HAN	Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
C-3PO	But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.
HAN	That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose.  Wookiees are known to do that.
C-3PO	I see your point, sir.  I suggest a new strategy, Artoo.  Let the Wookiee win.
OBI-WAN	Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.
LUKE	You mean it controls your actions?
OBI-WAN	Partially. But it also obeys your commands.
HAN	Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.
LUKE	You don't believe in the Force, do you?
HAN	Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.  I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
OBI-WAN	I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.
LUKE	With the blast shield down, I can't even see.  How am I supposed to fight?
OBI-WAN	Your eyes can deceive you.  Don't trust them. Stretch out with your feelings. You see, you can do it.
HAN	I call it luck.
OBI-WAN	In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.
HAN	Look, going good against remotes is one thing.  Going good against the living?  That's something else. Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.
LUKE	You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote.
OBI-WAN	That's good.  You have taken your first step into a larger world.
===	===
GANTRY OFFICER	TX-four-one-two.  Why aren't you at your post?  TX-four-one-two, do you copy? Take over.  We've got a bad transmitter.  I'll see what I can do.
LUKE	You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.
HAN	Bring them on!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
C-3PO	We found the computer outlet, sir.
OBI-WAN	Plug in.  He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.
C-3PO	He says he's found the main control to the power beam that's holding the ship here.  He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor. The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.
OBI-WAN	I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone.
HAN	Whatever you say.  I've done more than I bargained for on this trip already.
LUKE	I want to go with you.
OBI-WAN	Be patient, Luke.  Stay and watch over the droids.
LUKE	But he can...
OBI-WAN	They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.  Your destiny lies along a different path from mine.  The Force will be with you ... always!
HAN	Boy you said it, Chewie. Where did you dig up that old fossil?
LUKE	Ben is a great man.
HAN	Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.
LUKE	I didn't hear you give any ideas...
HAN	Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for them to pick us up...
LUKE	Who do you think... What is it?
C-3PO	"I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says ""I found her,"" and keeps repeating, ""She's here."""
LUKE	Well, who... who has he found?
C-3PO	Princess Leia.
LUKE	The princess?  She's here?
HAN	Princess?
LUKE	Where... where is she?
HAN	Princess?  What's going on?
C-3PO	Level five. Detention block AA- twenty-three.  I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.
LUKE	Oh, no!  We've got to do something.
HAN	What are you talking about?
LUKE	The droid belongs to her.  She's the one in the message.  We've got to help her.
HAN	Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.  The old man wants us to wait right here.
LUKE	But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?
HAN	I'm not going anywhere.
LUKE	They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured.  Now all you want to do is stay.
HAN	Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.
LUKE	But they're going to kill her!
HAN	Better her than me...
LUKE	She's rich.
HAN	Rich?
LUKE	Yes.  Rich, powerful!  Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...
HAN	What?
LUKE	Well more wealth that you can imagine.
HAN	I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!
LUKE	You'll get it!
HAN	I better!
LUKE	You will...
HAN	All right, kid.  But you'd better be right about this!
LUKE	All right.
HAN	What's your plan?
LUKE	Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders there will you? Okay.  Now, I'm going to put these on you. Okay.  Han, you put these on.
HAN	Don't worry, Chewie.  I think I know what he has in mind.
C-3PO	Master Luke, sir!  Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?
LUKE	Lock the door!
HAN	And hope they don't have blasters.
C-3PO	That isn't very reassuring.
===	===
HAN	Chewie! Get behind me!  Get behind me! Can't get out that way.
LEIA	Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.
HAN	Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness.
LUKE	See-Threepio!  See-Threepio!
C-3PO	Yes sir?
LUKE	We've been cut off!  Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?... What was that?  I didn't copy!
===	===
C-3PO	I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir. The main entrance seems to be the only way out; all other information on your level is restricted.
TROOPER VOICE	Open up in there!
C-3PO	Oh, no!
===	===
FIRST TROOPER	Take over! See to him!  Look there!
C-3PO	They're madmen!  They're heading for the prison level.  If you hurry, you might catch them.
FIRST OFFICER	Follow me!  You stand guard.
C-3PO	Come on! Oh!  All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here.  If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance.
TROOPER	All right.
===	===
C-3PO	They aren't here!  Something must have happened to them.  See if they've been captured. Hurry!
===	===
C-3PO	Thank goodness, they haven't found them!  Where could they be? Use the comlink?  Oh, my!  I forgot I turned it off!
===	===
C-3PO	Are you there, sir?
===	===
C-3PO	We've had some problems...
LUKE	Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level, will you? Do you copy?
===	===
LUKE	Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.
C-3PO	No.  Shut them all down!  Hurry! Listen to them!  They're dying, Artoo!  Curse my metal body!  I wasn't fast enough.  It's all my fault!  My poor master!
LUKE	Threepio, we're all right!
===	===
HAN	There she is.
LUKE	See-Threepio, do you copy?
C-3PO	For the moment.  Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship.
LUKE	We're right above you.  Stand by.
LEIA	You came in that thing?  You're braver that I thought.
HAN	Nice!  Come on!
FIRST TROOPER	It's them!  Blast them!
HAN	Get back to the ship!
LUKE	Where are you going?  Come back!
LEIA	He certainly has courage.
LUKE	What good will it do us if he gets himself killed?  Come on!
===	===
C-3PO	Where could they be?
===	===
C-3PO	Come on, Artoo, we're going!
===	===
C-3PO	Oooh!
===	===
C-3PO	Help!  I think I'm melting! This is all your fault.
===	===
LEIA	What's wrong?
LUKE	Oh, it's Han!  I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind.
LEIA	He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him.
LUKE	I only wish Ben were here.
BIGGS	Luke!  I don't believe it!  How'd you get here... are you going out with us?!
LUKE	Biggs!  Of course, I'll be up there with you!  Listen, have I got some stories to tell...
RED LEADER	Are you... Luke Skywalker?  Have you been checked out on the Incom T-sixty-five?
BIGGS	Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories.
RED LEADER	I met your father once when I was just a boy.  He was a great pilot. You'll do all right.  If you've got half of your father's skill, you'll do better than all right.
LUKE	Thank you, sir.  I'll try.
BIGGS	I've got to get aboard.  Listen, you'll tell me your stories when we come back.  All right?
LUKE	I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.
BIGGS	You did, all right.  It's going to be like old times Luke. We're a couple of shooting stars that'll never be stopped!
CHIEF	This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up.  Do you want a new one?
LUKE	Not on your life!  That little droid and I have been through a lot together. You okay, Artoo?
CHIEF	Okay, easy she goes!
C-3PO	Hang on tight, Artoo, you've got to come back. You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?
OBI-WAN	Luke, the Force will be with you.
===	===
C-3PO	Hang on, Artoo!
===	===
LEIA	Luke!  Luke!  Luke!
HAN	Hey!  Hey!
LUKE	I knew you'd come back!  I just knew it!
HAN	Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the reward.
LEIA	Hey, I knew there was more to you than money.
LUKE	Oh, no!
C-3PO	Oh, my!  Artoo!  Can you hear me? Say something! You can repair him, can't you?
TECHNICIAN	We'll get to work on him right away.
C-3PO	You must repair him!  Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them.
LUKE	He'll be all right.
===	===
C-3PO	Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place. Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, You'd probably short-circuit. Artoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose.
===	===
C-3PO	There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master Luke.
STRANGE VOICE	Tee chuta hhat yudd!
C-3PO	Goodness gracious me! Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt. I don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go. Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this. Oh, Artoo!  Artoo, wait for me!
===	===
C-3PO	Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no.
BIB	Die Wanna Wanga!
C-3PO	Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt. ... and a gift. (thinks a moment, then to Artoo) Gift, what gift?
BIB	Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.
C-3PO	He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself. I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things.
BIB	Nudd Chaa.
C-3PO	Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this.
===	===
C-3PO	Good morning.
JABBA	Bo Shuda!
C-3PO	The message, Artoo, the message.
LUKE	Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. (Jabba's crowd laughs) With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids.
C-3PO	What did he say?
LUKE	... Both are hardworking and will serve you well.
C-3PO	This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message.
JABBA	There will be no bargain.
C-3PO	We're doomed.
JABBA	I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he is.
C-3PO	Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite.
===	===
C-3PO	What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!
===	===
NINEDENINE	Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
C-3PO	I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
NINEDENINE	Yes or no will do.
C-3PO	Oh. Well, yes.
NINEDENINE	How many languages do you speak?
C-3PO	I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
NINEDENINE	Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
C-3PO	Disintegrated?
NINEDENINE	Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining bolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber.
C-3PO	Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh!
NINEDENINE	You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have need for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in nicely.
===	===
JABBA	Da Eitha!
OOLA	Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota...
JABBA	Boscka!
BOUSHH	I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.
C-3PO	Oh, no! Chewbacca!
JABBA	At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.
C-3PO	Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes! Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty- five thousand.
BOUSHH	I want fifty thousand. No less.
C-3PO	Uh, oh... but what, what did I say? (to Boushh) Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand. Because he's holding a thermal detonator.
JABBA	This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive.
C-3PO	Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.
BOUSHH	Zeebuss.
C-3PO	He agrees!
===	===
BOUSHH	Just relax for a moment. You're free of the carbonite. Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
HAN	I can't see.
BOUSHH	You eyesight will return in time.
HAN	Where am I?
BOUSHH	Jabba's palace.
HAN	Who are you?
LEIA	Someone who loves you.
HAN	Leia!
LEIA	I gotta get you out of here.
HAN	What's that? I know that laugh. Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault.
JABBA	It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but now you're Bantha fodder.
HAN	Look...
JABBA	Take him away!
HAN	Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be a fool!
JABBA	Bring her to me.
LEIA	We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this...
JABBA	I'm sure.
LEIA	Ugh!
C-3PO	Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
===	===
C-3PO	At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.
BIB	Master. ...Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight.
JABBA	I told you not to admit him.
LUKE	I must be allowed to speak.
BIB	He must be allowed to speak.
JABBA	You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick.
LUKE	You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.
JABBA	Your mind powers will not work on me, boy.
LUKE	Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers.
C-3PO	Master Luke, you're standing on...
JABBA	There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die. Bascka!
===	===
C-3PO	Oh, no! The Rancor!
===	===
LUKE	Han!
HAN	Luke!
LUKE	Are you all right?
HAN	Fine. Together again, huh?
LUKE	Wouldn't miss it.
HAN	How are we doing?
LUKE	The same as always.
HAN	That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
LEIA	I'm here.
C-3PO	Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
HAN	Good, I hate long waits.
C-3PO	You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.
HAN	Doesn't sound so bad.
C-3PO	In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
HAN	On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
LUKE	You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever make.
===	===
JABBA	Soon you will learn to appreciate me.
C-3PO	Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here? Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too! Hmm.  I wish I had your confidence.
===	===
C-3PO	Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas.
===	===
LEIA	Come on. We gotta get out of here quick.
C-3PO	Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!
===	===
LUKE	Get the gun! Point it at the deck! Point it at the deck!
C-3PO	Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump.
LUKE	Come on!
===	===
HAN	Well, look at you, a general, huh?
LANDO	Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
HAN	Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack.
LANDO	I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.
HAN	Well, who says they didn't.  But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember?
MON MOTHMA	The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come. The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star. Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.
ACKBAR	You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor. General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack
HAN	Good luck. You're gonna need it.
ACKBAR	General Madine.
GENERAL MADINE	We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator.
C-3PO	Sounds dangerous.
LEIA	I wonder who they found to pull that off.
GENERAL MADINE	General Solo, is your strike team assembled?
HAN	Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle. Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you. That's one.
LEIA	Uh, General... count me in.
VOICE	I'm with you, too!
LEIA	What is it?
LUKE	Ask me again sometime.
HAN	Luke.
LUKE	Hi, Han... Chewie.
C-3PO	Exciting is hardly the word I would use.
===	===
HAN	You got her warmed?
LUKE	Yeah, she's comin' up.
HAN	No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
LEIA	Hey, are you awake?
HAN	Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
LEIA	Come on, General, let's move.
HAN	Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
LUKE	All set.
C-3PO	Here we go again.
HAN	All right, hang on.
===	===
C-3PO	Oh, I told you it was dangerous here.
LEIA	Shall we try and go around?
HAN	It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
===	===
C-3PO	Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!
HAN	Luke! Where's Leia?
LUKE	What? She didn't come back?
HAN	I thought she was with you.
LUKE	We got separated. Hey, we better go look for her.
HAN	Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
LUKE	Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
C-3PO	Don't worry, Master Luke.  We know what to do. And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!
===	===
HAN	Luke! Luke!
C-3PO	Oh, Master Luke.
LUKE	There's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.
C-3PO	I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.
HAN	I hope she's alright. What, Chewie? What? Chewie!
===	===
HAN	Hey, I don't get it. Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie.
LUKE	Chewie, wa-wait!  Don't!
HAN	Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.
LUKE	Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. (trying to free an arm) Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
HAN	Yeah, sure.
C-3PO	Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-op!!
HAN	Wha--?  Hey!  Point that thing someplace else. Hey!
LUKE	Han, don't. It'll be all right. Chewie, give 'em your crossbow.
C-3PO	Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness!
LUKE	Do you understand anything they're saying?
C-3PO	Oh, yes, Master Luke!  Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication.
HAN	What are you telling them?
C-3PO	Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
HAN	Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
C-3PO	I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
HAN	Proper?!
C-3PO	It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
HAN	Why, you-- My mistake. He's an old friend of mine.
===	===
HAN	I have a really bad feeling about this. What did he say?
C-3PO	I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
HAN	Leia!
LEIA	Oh!
C-3PO	Your Royal Highness.
LEIA	But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free.
HAN	Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
LUKE	Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
C-3PO	But Master Luke, what magic? couldn't possibly --
LUKE	Just tell them.
C-3PO	You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just... ... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh! Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh! Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness.
LUKE	Thanks, Threepio.
C-3PO	I...I never knew I had it in me.
===	===
C-3PO	Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that.
HAN	What's going on?
LEIA	I don't know.
C-3PO	Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.
HAN	Just what I always wanted. Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie. (to Wicket) Thank you. Okay.
C-3PO	He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator.
HAN	Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back. And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day.
===	===
LEIA	The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
HAN	Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
LEIA	What's he saying?
C-3PO	He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
===	===
HAN	Back door, huh? Good idea. It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble.
LEIA	Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm.
HAN	Then we'll do it real quiet-like.
C-3PO	Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
LEIA	Quiet.
C-3PO	I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
LEIA	Oh, no.
===	===
HAN	Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this.
C-3PO	I have decided that we shall stay here.
===	===
HAN	All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie.
LEIA	Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
HAN	Charges!  Come on, come on!
C-3PO	Oh, my! They'll be captured! Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me.
COMMANDER	Freeze! You Rebel scum.
===	===
STORMTROOPER	All right, move it! I said move it! Go on!
C-3PO	Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me?
BUNKER COMMANDER	Bring those two down here!
STORMTROOPER	Let's go!
C-3PO	Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea?
STORMTROOPER	Freeze! Don't move!
C-3PO	We surrender. Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo.
LEIA	The code's changed. We need Artoo!
HAN	Here's the terminal.
LEIA	Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away.
C-3PO	Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!
===	===
C-3PO	We're coming!
HAN	Come on! Come on!
C-3PO	Oh, Artoo, hurry! My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
HAN	Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
LEIA	I'll cover you.
===	===
HAN	I think I got it. I got it!
C-3PO	Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
HAN	Let's see.
LEIA	It's not bad.
STORMTROOPER	Freeze!
C-3PO	Oh, dear.
STORMTROOPER	Don't move!
HAN	I love you.
LEIA	I know.
STORMTROOPER	Hands up! Stand up!
HAN	Stay back. Chewie!  Get down here!  She's wounded!  No, wait....  I got an idea.
===	===
HAN	Lando...
C-3PO	(misinterpreting Han's reference) They did it!
===	===
C-3PO	Don't try to blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess's chamber. But it's supposed to be freezing. How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don't know. Oh, switch off.
===	===
HAN	Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us out of here and you pull both of these.
C-3PO	Excuse me, sir.
HAN	Put them back together right now.
C-3PO	Might I have a word with you, please?
HAN	What do you want?
C-3PO	Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator.
HAN	I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.
C-3PO	Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is.
HAN	I don't know where he is.
C-3PO	Nobody knows where he is.
HAN	"What do you mean, ""nobody knows""?"
C-3PO	Well, uh, you see...
HAN	Deck Officer. Deck Officer!
C-3PO	Excuse me, sir. Might I inqu-...
DECK OFFICER	Yes, sir?
HAN	Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?
DECK OFFICER	I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in through the south entrance.
HAN	It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out there.
DECK OFFICER	Yes, sir.
C-3PO	Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on?
HAN	Why not?
C-3PO	Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, lets find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger.
===	===
C-3PO	You must come along now, Artoo. There's really nothing more we can do. And my joints are freezing up. Don't say thing like that! Of course we'll see Master Luke again. He'll be quite all right, you'll see. (to himself) Stupid little short-circuit. He'll be quite all right.
===	===
LIEUTENANT	Sir, all the patrols are in. There's still no contact from Skywalker or Solo.
C-3PO	Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope.
DERLIN	Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight. The shield doors must be closed. Close the doors.
LIEUTENANT	Yes, sir.
C-3PO	Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventy-five...to one. Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes...from time to time. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll be all right. He's quite clever, you know...for a human being.
===	===
C-3PO	Master Luke, sir, it's good to see you fully functional again. Artoo expresses his relief, also.
HAN	How are you feeling, kid? You don't look so bad to me. In fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark.
LUKE	Thanks to you.
HAN	That's two you owe me, junior. Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer.
LEIA	I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield.
HAN	That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.
LEIA	I don't know where you get you delusions, laser brain.
HAN	Laugh it up, fuzz ball. But you didn't see us alone in the south passage. She expressed her true feelings for me.
LEIA	My...! Why, you stuck up,...half-witted,...scruffy-looking... nerf-herder!
HAN	Who's scruffy-looking?  I must have hit her pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?
LEIA	Why, I guess you don't know everything about women yet?
ANNOUNCER	Headquarters personnel, report to command center.
HAN	Take it easy.
C-3PO	Excuse us, please.
===	===
RIEEKAN	Princess...we have a visitor. We've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve, moving east.
SENIOR CONTROLLER	It's metal.
LEIA	Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke.
HAN	It could be a speeder, one of ours.
SENIOR CONTROLLER	No. Wait -- there's something very weak coming through.
C-3PO	Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code.
HAN	It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let's check it out.
RIEEKAN	Send Rouges Ten and Eleven to station three-eight.
===	===
HAN	No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. right?
C-3PO	Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand? And...do take care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear.
===	===
HAN	You all right?
LEIA	Why are you still here?
HAN	I heard the command center had been hit.
LEIA	You got your clearance to leave.
HAN	Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm going to get you to your ship.
C-3PO	Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our only hope.
LEIA	Send all troops in sector twelve to the south slope to protect the fighters.
ANNOUNCER	Imperial troops have entered the base.
HAN	Come on...that's it.
LEIA	Give the evacuation code signal. And get to your transports!
HEAD CONTROLLER	K-one-zero...all troops disengage.
C-3PO	Oh! Wait for me!
===	===
HAN	Transport, this is Solo. Better take off -- I can't get to you. I'll get the princess out on the Falcon.
C-3PO	But...but...but...where are you going? Uh...come back!!
===	===
C-3PO	Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop! How typical.
HAN	Come on.
===	===
HAN	Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a permanent resident!
C-3PO	Wait! Wait!
===	===
HAN	How's this?
LEIA	Would it helped if I got out and pushed?
HAN	It might.
C-3PO	Captain Solo, Captain Solo...sir, might I suggest that you... It can wait.
===	===
HAN	I saw them! I saw them!
LEIA	Saw what?
HAN	Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us.
C-3PO	Sir, sir! Might I suggest...
HAN	Shut him up or shut him down!  Check the deflector shield! Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them.
===	===
HAN	Prepare to make the jump to light-speed.
C-3PO	But, sir!
LEIA	They're getting closer!
HAN	Oh yeah? Watch this.
LEIA	Watch what?
HAN	I think we're in trouble.
C-3PO	If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed!
HAN	We're in trouble!
===	===
LEIA	Asteroids!
HAN	Oh, no! Chewie, set two-seven-one.
LEIA	What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid field?
HAN	They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?
LEIA	You don't have to do this to impress me.
C-3PO	Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one.
HAN	Never tell me the odds!
===	===
HAN	You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be it, sweetheart.
LEIA	I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
HAN	I'm not going to argue with that.
C-3PO	Pulverized?
HAN	I'm going in closer to one of the big ones.
LEIA	Closer?
C-3PO	Closer?!
===	===
C-3PO	Oh, this is suicide!
HAN	There. That looks pretty good.
LEIA	What looks pretty good?
HAN	Yeah. That'll do nicely.
C-3PO	Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going?
===	===
HAN	I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.
C-3PO	Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but...does that include shutting me down, too?
HAN	No, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.
C-3PO	Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable.
HAN	Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these things.  Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive.
C-3PO	Oh! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most...
LEIA	Let go.
HAN	Sshh!
LEIA	Let go, please.
HAN	Don't get excited.
LEIA	Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited.
HAN	Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else.
===	===
C-3PO	Oh, where is Artoo when I need him? Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.
HAN	Well, of course I'll have to replace it. Here! And Chewie... ...I think we'd better replace the negative power coupling. Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help.
LEIA	Would you please stop calling me that?
HAN	Sure, Leia.
LEIA	Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes.
HAN	I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though. (he watches her reaction) Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right.
LEIA	Occasionally  maybe...when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
HAN	Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that.
LEIA	Stop that.
HAN	Stop what?
LEIA	Stop that! My hands are dirty.
HAN	My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of?
LEIA	Afraid?
HAN	You're trembling.
LEIA	I'm not trembling.
HAN	You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life.
LEIA	I happen to like nice men.
HAN	I'm a nice man.
LEIA	No, you're not. You're...
C-3PO	Sir, sir! I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling.
HAN	Thank you. Thank you very much.
C-3PO	Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.
===	===
C-3PO	Sir, if I may venture an opinion...
HAN	I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio.
LEIA	There's something out there.
HAN	Where?
LEIA	Outside, in the cave.
C-3PO	There it is. Listen! Listen!
HAN	I'm going out there.
LEIA	Are you crazy?!
HAN	I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let something tear it apart.
LEIA	Then I'm going with you.
C-3PO	I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. (hears another mysterious noise) Oh, no.
===	===
LEIA	This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock at all.
HAN	There's an awful lot of moisture in here.
LEIA	I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this.
HAN	Yeah. Watch out! Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables.
LEIA	Mynocks?
HAN	Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more.
C-3PO	Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly thing. Shoo! Shoo!
HAN	Wait a minute...
===	===
LEIA	You can't make the jump to light-speed in this asteroid field...
HAN	Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off!
C-3PO	Look!
HAN	I see it, I see it.
C-3PO	We're doomed!
LEIA	The cave is collapsing.
HAN	This is no cave.
LEIA	What?
===	===
C-3PO	Oh, thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field.
===	===
HAN	Let's get out of here. Ready for light-speed? One...two...three! It's not fair! The transfer circuits are working. It's not my fault!
LEIA	No light-speed?
HAN	It's not my fault.
C-3PO	Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
HAN	Turn her around. I said turn her around! I'm going to put all power in the front shield.
LEIA	You're going to attack them?!
C-3PO	Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial Star Destroyer...
LEIA	Shut up!
===	===
C-3PO	Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. (Chewie growls) No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me?
HAN	The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw.
C-3PO	I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough...
HAN	Thank you.
LEIA	What did you have in mind for your next move?
HAN	Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away.
LEIA	With the rest of the garbage. Then what?
HAN	Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any ideas?
LEIA	No. Where are we?
HAN	The Anoat system.
LEIA	Anoat system. There's not much there.
HAN	No. Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando.
LEIA	Lando system?
HAN	Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian. He's a card player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him.
LEIA	Thanks.
HAN	Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it.
LEIA	A mining colony?
HAN	Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me.
LEIA	Can you trust him?
HAN	No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that. Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach!
LEIA	You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them.
===	===
HAN	No, I don't have a landing permit. I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian. Whoa! Wait a minute! Let me explain.
INTERCOM VOICE	You will not deviate from your present course.
C-3PO	Rather touchy, aren't they?
LEIA	I thought you knew this person.
HAN	Well, that was a long time ago. I'm sure he's forgotten about that.
INTERCOM VOICE	Permission granted to land on Platform Three-two-seven.
HAN	Thank you. There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me.
LEIA	Who's worried?
===	===
C-3PO	Oh. No one to meet us.
LEIA	I don't like this.
HAN	Well, what would you like?
C-3PO	Well, they did let us land.
HAN	Look, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Trust me.
===	===
C-3PO	Well, he seems very friendly.
LEIA	Yes...very friendly.
===	===
LANDO	What are you doing here?
HAN	Ahh...repairs. I thought you could help me out.
LANDO	What have you done to my ship?
HAN	Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square.
LANDO	Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm the administrator of this facility. and who might you be?
LEIA	Leia.
LANDO	Welcome, Leia.
HAN	All right, all right, you old smoothie.
C-3PO	Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My facilities are at your... Well, really!
LANDO	What's wrong with the Falcon?
HAN	Hyperdrive.
LANDO	I'll get my people to work on it.
HAN	Good.
LANDO	You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times. She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.
===	===
HAN	How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you?
LANDO	Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties...(catches Han grinning at him) What's so funny?
HAN	You. Listen to you -- you sound like a businessman, a responsible leader. Who'd have thought that, huh?
LANDO	You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things.
HAN	Yeah.
LANDO	Yeah, I'm responsible these days. It's the price you pay for being successful.
C-3PO	Oh! Nice to see a familiar face.
SECOND THREEPIO	E chu ta!
C-3PO	How rude!
===	===
C-3PO	That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if... Hello? How interesting. Oh, my.
MAN	Who are you?
C-3PO	Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I...I didn't mean to intrude. No, no, please don't get up. No!
===	===
C-3PO	Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh -- Take this off! I, uh, don't mean to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no...Please don't get up. No! Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the others. Oh, no! I've been shot!
===	===
C-3PO	Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not right because now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough...
HAN	I feel terrible.
LEIA	Why are they doing this?
HAN	They never even asked me any questions.
LEIA	Lando.
HAN	Get out of here, Lando!
LANDO	Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.
HAN	Over to you?
LANDO	They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
LEIA	What about Han?
LANDO	Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter.
LEIA	Vader wants us all dead.
LANDO	He doesn't want you at all. He's after somebody called Skywalker.
HAN	Luke?
LANDO	Lord Vader has set a trap for him.
LEIA	And we're the bait.
LANDO	Well, he's on his way.
HAN	Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you? My friend!
LANDO	Stop! I've done all I can do. I'm sorry I couldn't do better, but I have my own problems.
HAN	Yeah, you're a real hero.
LEIA	You certainly have a way with people.
===	===
C-3PO	If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish.
HAN	What's going on...buddy?
LANDO	You're being put into carbon freeze.
BOBA FETT	What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me.
VADER	The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in!
C-3PO	Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...!
HAN	Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop!
C-3PO	Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die.
HAN	Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey! Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess -- you have to take care of her. You hear me?
LEIA	I love you!
HAN	I know.
C-3PO	What...what's going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see. Oh...they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected -- if he survives the freezing process, that is.
VADER	Well, Calrissian, did he survive?
LANDO	Yes, he's alive. And in perfect hibernation.
VADER	He's all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker.
IMPERIAL OFFICER	Skywalker has just landed, my lord.
VADER	Good. See to it that he finds his way here. Calrissian, take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship.
LANDO	You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision.
VADER	I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.
===	===
LANDO	Well done. Hold them in the security tower -- and keep it quiet. Move.
LEIA	What do you think you're doing?
LANDO	We're getting out of here.
C-3PO	I knew all along it had to be a mistake.
LEIA	Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust you?
LANDO	I had no choice...
C-3PO	What are you doing? Trust him, trust him!
LEIA	Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice.
LANDO	I'm just trying to help...
LEIA	We don't need any of your help.
LANDO	H-a-a-a...
LEIA	What?
C-3PO	It sounds like Han.
LANDO	There's still a chance to save Han...I mean, at the East Platform...
LEIA	Chewie.
C-3PO	I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all, he's only a Wookiee.
===	===
C-3PO	Artoo! Artoo! Where have you been? Turn around, you wooly...!  Hurry, hurry! We're trying to save Han from the bounty hunter! Well, at least your still in one piece! Look what happened to me!
===	===
C-3PO	Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!
===	===
LANDO	The security codes has been changed!
C-3PO	Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security system.
LANDO	Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has takes control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive. This way.
C-3PO	Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal.
===	===
C-3PO	What are you talking about? We're not interested in the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. It's fixed! Just open the door, you stupid lump. I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful!
===	===
C-3PO	Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt, Bend down, you thoughtless...Ow!
LANDO	Leia! Go!
===	===
C-3PO	I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. Of course, I've looked better.
===	===
C-3PO	Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light-speed? We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated? The city's central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo, you know better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing!
===	===
C-3PO	Artoo, come back at once! You haven't finished with me yet! You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it. I'm standing here in pieces, and you're having delusions of grandeur!
===	===
C-3PO	Oh, you did it!
===	===
