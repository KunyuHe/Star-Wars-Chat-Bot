ANAKIN	Thank you, Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the Separatists, but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to take advantage of.
C-3PO	It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that. Well, there, I agree with you. In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.
===	===
MOTEE	Yes, my lady.
C-3PO	Is there anything I might do for you, my lady?
===	===
PADME	I truly, deeply love you. Before I die. I want you to know.
C-3PO	My Lady, are you. . . . Are you all right?
===	===
PADME	Captain Typho's here, we're safe. What's happening?
C-3PO	What is going on? You can't be anymore confused than I am.
ANAKIN	I couldn't either at first, but it's true. I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the Chancellor myself.
C-3PO	Something important is going on! I heard a rumor they are going to banish all droids. Shhhhhh . . . not so loud. Whatever it is, we'll be the last to know.
PADME	I will.
C-3PO	Well, he is under a lot of stress, Artoo. Take care, my little friend. My Lady, is there anything I might do?
PADME	No.
C-3PO	I feel so helpless.
===	===
OBI-WAN	Has Anakin been here . . . ?
C-3PO	Yes . . . right after the attack on the Jedi Temple.
===	===
PADME	I'll be all right, Captain. This is something I must do myself. Besides, Threepio will look after me.
C-3PO	Oh, dear.
===	===
YODA	Save them, we must. They are our last hope.
C-3PO	It s some kind of reproductive process, I think.
===	===
BAIL ORGANA	I'm placing these droids in your care. Treat them well. Clean them up. Have the Protocol Droid's mind wiped.
C-3PO	Oh, no.
===	===
ANAKIN	Threepio?
C-3PO	Oh, my... oh, my! Master Anakin! My goodness, I can hardly believe it! And this must be Miss Padme.
ANAKIN	I've come to see my mother.
C-3PO	Oh, dear! I'm so terribly sorry, Master Annie.
PADME	Threepio, what's happened?
C-3PO	I think we'd better go inside.
===	===
PADME	I'm not leaving, Threepio. I just can't sleep.
C-3PO	That's something I cannot relate to. As a Protocol Droid, I'm either active or inactive. There's no in-between.
PADME	I guess you're lucky.
C-3PO	Do you really think so..? I suppose I shouldn't expect...
PADME	You're not happy here?
C-3PO	Oh, I'm not unhappy... and my masters here ar so kind I wouldn't wish to trouuble them, it's just... being like this... well, it's embarrassing.
PADME	Being like what?
C-3PO	Naked. If you pardon the expression. You see, when Master Annie made me, he never quite found the time to give me any outer covering. It's so humiliating. How would you like it if you had to go around with all your circuits showing?
PADME	I guess I wouldn't like it at all.
C-3PO	Of course you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's simply not protocol.
PADME	Maybe we can do something about it.
C-3PO	I don't think so. Only Master Annie...
PADME	Why not? They seem to have a box of old coverings here.
C-3PO	Oh? How observant of you, Miss Padme. Of course, I'm just not mechanically minded... if you see what I mean.
PADME	Let's see, if we put this... here...
C-3PO	Ooooh! That's tickles.
===	===
PADME	There!
C-3PO	Um. How do I look?
OWEN	Great! You look perfect.
C-3PO	Perfect? Oh, Miss Padme, I'm so happy! Oh, pardon me. Thank you. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
OWEN	Well, Padme, I think he should be yours from now on... I know that is what my Mom would want.
C-3PO	Oh, my!
===	===
PADME	Don't you give me orders, Annie! I'm a Senator of the Galactic Republic. You have no authority to contain me, restrain me, or direct me! You remember your place, young man. Now you can come along and protect me or stay here. It's up to you.
C-3PO	Yes, it is, Artoo. Most confusing. One moment they're generating a pleasant mutual attraction and the next, waves of violent hostility. Even though I'm programmed to understand them, I doubt if I ever shall.
===	===
OWEN	I have no need for a protocol droid.
C-3PO	Sir - not in an environment such as this - that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...
OWEN	What I really need is a droid that understands the binary languages of moisture vaporators.
C-3PO	Vaporators!  Sir - My first job was programming binary load lifters ... very similar to your vaporators. You could say...
OWEN	Do you speak Bocce?
C-3PO	Of course I can, sir.  It's like a second language for me...  I'm as fluent in Bocce...
OWEN	All right; shut up! I'll take this one.
C-3PO	Shutting up, sir.
OWEN	Hey, what're you trying to push on us?
C-3PO	Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition.  A real bargain.
LUKE	Yeah, take it away.
C-3PO	Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir.  He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before.  Here he comes.
LUKE	Okay, let's go.
C-3PO	Now, don't forget this!  Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity!
===	===
LUKE	It just isn't fair.  Oh, Biggs is right.  I'm never gonna get out of here!
C-3PO	Is there anything I might do to help?
LUKE	Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!
C-3PO	I don't think so, sir.  I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.  Not on this planet, anyways.  As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.
LUKE	Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.
C-3PO	I see, sir.
LUKE	Uh, you can call me Luke.
C-3PO	I see, sir Luke.
LUKE	Just Luke.
C-3PO	And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.
LUKE	Hello. You got a lot of carbon scoring here.  It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.
C-3PO	With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.
LUKE	You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?
C-3PO	That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.
LUKE	Have you been in many battles?
C-3PO	Several, I think.  Actually, there's not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.
LUKE	What's this?
C-3PO	What is what?!?  He asked you a question... What is that?
LEIA	Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.
C-3PO	Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction.  Old data. Pay it no mind.
LUKE	Who is she?  She's beautiful.
C-3PO	I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
LEIA	Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...
C-3PO	I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.  A person of some importance, sir - I believe.  Our captain was attached to...
LUKE	Is there more to this recording?
C-3PO	Behave yourself, Artoo.  You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him.  He's our new master. He says he's the property of Obi- Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts.  And it's a private message for him.  Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what he's talking about.  Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.
LUKE	Obi-Wan Kenobi?  I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?
C-3PO	I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?
LUKE	Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea.  He's kind of a strange old hermit. I wonder who she is.  It sounds like she's in trouble.  I'd better play back the whole thing.
C-3PO	He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system.  He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.
LUKE	H'm?  Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off!  Okay. There you go. Well, wait a minute.  Where'd she go?  Bring her back!  Play back the entire message.
C-3PO	What message?  The one you√ïve just been playing.  The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards!
LUKE	All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.
C-3PO	I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.
LUKE	Well, see what you can do with him.  I'll be right back.
C-3PO	Just you reconsider playing that message for him. No, I don't think he likes you at all. No, I don't like you either.
===	===
LUKE	What are you doing hiding there?
C-3PO	It wasn't my fault, sir.  Please don't deactivate me.  I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.
===	===
LUKE	How could I be so stupid?  He's nowhere in sight.  Blast it!
C-3PO	Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?
LUKE	All right, I'll be there in a few minutes.  Boy, am I gonna get it. You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.
C-3PO	Oh, he excels at that, sir.
===	===
LUKE	How's that. Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far.  We must have missed him.  Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well.
C-3PO	Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault.
LUKE	Sure.  He needs you.  He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...
C-3PO	Deactivate!  Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt...
===	===
LUKE	Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?
C-3PO	Master Luke here is your rightful owner.  We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me of your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.
LUKE	Well, come on. It's getting late. I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up.
C-3PO	If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop.
LUKE	No, he's not going to try anything. What's wrong with him now?
C-3PO	Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.
===	===
LUKE	Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before the Sand People return.
C-3PO	I don't think I can make it.  You go on, Master Luke.  There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
===	===
OBI-WAN	He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.  And he was a good friend.  Which reminds me... I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.
C-3PO	Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile.
===	===
LUKE	I'm ready for anything.
C-3PO	Come along, Artoo.
===	===
LUKE	Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder.  We don't want any trouble.
C-3PO	I heartily agree with you sir.
===	===
TROOPER	All right, check that side of the street.  It's secure.  Move on to the next door.
C-3PO	I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you.  I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault. You watch your language!
===	===
HAN	Chewie, get us out of here!
C-3PO	Oh, my.  I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.
===	===
HAN	Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.  I told you I'd outrun 'em. Don't everyone thank me at once. Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.
C-3PO	Now be careful, Artoo. He made a fair move.  Screaming about it won't help you.
HAN	Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
C-3PO	But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.
HAN	That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose.  Wookiees are known to do that.
C-3PO	I see your point, sir.  I suggest a new strategy, Artoo.  Let the Wookiee win.
===	===
HAN	Bring them on!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
C-3PO	We found the computer outlet, sir.
OBI-WAN	Plug in.  He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.
C-3PO	He says he's found the main control to the power beam that's holding the ship here.  He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor. The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.
LUKE	Who do you think... What is it?
C-3PO	"I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says ""I found her,"" and keeps repeating, ""She's here."""
LUKE	Well, who... who has he found?
C-3PO	Princess Leia.
HAN	Princess?  What's going on?
C-3PO	Level five. Detention block AA- twenty-three.  I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.
HAN	Don't worry, Chewie.  I think I know what he has in mind.
C-3PO	Master Luke, sir!  Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?
HAN	And hope they don't have blasters.
C-3PO	That isn't very reassuring.
===	===
LUKE	See-Threepio!  See-Threepio!
C-3PO	Yes sir?
===	===
TROOPER VOICE	Open up in there!
C-3PO	Oh, no!
===	===
FIRST TROOPER	Take over! See to him!  Look there!
C-3PO	They're madmen!  They're heading for the prison level.  If you hurry, you might catch them.
FIRST OFFICER	Follow me!  You stand guard.
C-3PO	Come on! Oh!  All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here.  If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance.
===	===
LUKE	Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.
C-3PO	No.  Shut them all down!  Hurry! Listen to them!  They're dying, Artoo!  Curse my metal body!  I wasn't fast enough.  It's all my fault!  My poor master!
===	===
LUKE	See-Threepio, do you copy?
C-3PO	For the moment.  Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship.
===	===
CHIEF	Okay, easy she goes!
C-3PO	Hang on tight, Artoo, you've got to come back. You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?
===	===
LUKE	Oh, no!
C-3PO	Oh, my!  Artoo!  Can you hear me? Say something! You can repair him, can't you?
TECHNICIAN	We'll get to work on him right away.
C-3PO	You must repair him!  Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them.
===	===
STRANGE VOICE	Tee chuta hhat yudd!
C-3PO	Goodness gracious me! Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt. I don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go. Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this. Oh, Artoo!  Artoo, wait for me!
===	===
BIB	Die Wanna Wanga!
C-3PO	Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt. ... and a gift. (thinks a moment, then to Artoo) Gift, what gift?
BIB	Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.
C-3PO	He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself. I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things.
BIB	Nudd Chaa.
C-3PO	Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this.
===	===
JABBA	Bo Shuda!
C-3PO	The message, Artoo, the message.
LUKE	Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. (Jabba's crowd laughs) With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids.
C-3PO	What did he say?
LUKE	... Both are hardworking and will serve you well.
C-3PO	This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message.
JABBA	There will be no bargain.
C-3PO	We're doomed.
JABBA	I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he is.
C-3PO	Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite.
===	===
NINEDENINE	Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
C-3PO	I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
NINEDENINE	Yes or no will do.
C-3PO	Oh. Well, yes.
NINEDENINE	How many languages do you speak?
C-3PO	I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
NINEDENINE	Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
C-3PO	Disintegrated?
NINEDENINE	Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining bolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber.
C-3PO	Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh!
===	===
BOUSHH	I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.
C-3PO	Oh, no! Chewbacca!
JABBA	At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.
C-3PO	Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes! Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty- five thousand.
BOUSHH	I want fifty thousand. No less.
C-3PO	Uh, oh... but what, what did I say? (to Boushh) Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand. Because he's holding a thermal detonator.
JABBA	This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive.
C-3PO	Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.
BOUSHH	Zeebuss.
C-3PO	He agrees!
===	===
LEIA	Ugh!
C-3PO	Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
===	===
LUKE	Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers.
C-3PO	Master Luke, you're standing on...
===	===
LEIA	I'm here.
C-3PO	Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
HAN	Good, I hate long waits.
C-3PO	You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.
HAN	Doesn't sound so bad.
C-3PO	In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
===	===
JABBA	Soon you will learn to appreciate me.
C-3PO	Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here? Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too! Hmm.  I wish I had your confidence.
===	===
LEIA	Come on. We gotta get out of here quick.
C-3PO	Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!
===	===
LUKE	Get the gun! Point it at the deck! Point it at the deck!
C-3PO	Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump.
===	===
GENERAL MADINE	We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator.
C-3PO	Sounds dangerous.
LUKE	Hi, Han... Chewie.
C-3PO	Exciting is hardly the word I would use.
===	===
LUKE	All set.
C-3PO	Here we go again.
===	===
LUKE	Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
C-3PO	Don't worry, Master Luke.  We know what to do. And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!
===	===
HAN	Luke! Luke!
C-3PO	Oh, Master Luke.
LUKE	There's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.
C-3PO	I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.
===	===
HAN	Yeah, sure.
C-3PO	Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-op!!
LUKE	Han, don't. It'll be all right. Chewie, give 'em your crossbow.
C-3PO	Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness!
LUKE	Do you understand anything they're saying?
C-3PO	Oh, yes, Master Luke!  Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication.
HAN	What are you telling them?
C-3PO	Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
HAN	Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
C-3PO	I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
HAN	Proper?!
C-3PO	It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
===	===
HAN	I have a really bad feeling about this. What did he say?
C-3PO	I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
LEIA	Oh!
C-3PO	Your Royal Highness.
LUKE	Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
C-3PO	But Master Luke, what magic? couldn't possibly --
LUKE	Just tell them.
C-3PO	You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just... ... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh! Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh! Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness.
LUKE	Thanks, Threepio.
C-3PO	I...I never knew I had it in me.
===	===
LEIA	I don't know.
C-3PO	Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.
HAN	Just what I always wanted. Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie. (to Wicket) Thank you. Okay.
C-3PO	He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator.
===	===
LEIA	What's he saying?
C-3PO	He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
===	===
HAN	Then we'll do it real quiet-like.
C-3PO	Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
LEIA	Quiet.
C-3PO	I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
===	===
HAN	Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this.
C-3PO	I have decided that we shall stay here.
===	===
HAN	Charges!  Come on, come on!
C-3PO	Oh, my! They'll be captured! Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me.
===	===
STORMTROOPER	All right, move it! I said move it! Go on!
C-3PO	Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me?
STORMTROOPER	Let's go!
C-3PO	Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea?
STORMTROOPER	Freeze! Don't move!
C-3PO	We surrender. Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo.
LEIA	Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away.
C-3PO	Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!
===	===
HAN	Come on! Come on!
C-3PO	Oh, Artoo, hurry! My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
===	===
HAN	I think I got it. I got it!
C-3PO	Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
STORMTROOPER	Freeze!
C-3PO	Oh, dear.
===	===
HAN	Lando...
C-3PO	(misinterpreting Han's reference) They did it!
===	===
HAN	Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us out of here and you pull both of these.
C-3PO	Excuse me, sir.
HAN	Put them back together right now.
C-3PO	Might I have a word with you, please?
HAN	What do you want?
C-3PO	Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator.
HAN	I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.
C-3PO	Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is.
HAN	I don't know where he is.
C-3PO	Nobody knows where he is.
HAN	"What do you mean, ""nobody knows""?"
C-3PO	Well, uh, you see...
HAN	Deck Officer. Deck Officer!
C-3PO	Excuse me, sir. Might I inqu-...
DECK OFFICER	Yes, sir.
C-3PO	Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on?
HAN	Why not?
C-3PO	Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, lets find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger.
===	===
LIEUTENANT	Sir, all the patrols are in. There's still no contact from Skywalker or Solo.
C-3PO	Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope.
LIEUTENANT	Yes, sir.
C-3PO	Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventy-five...to one. Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes...from time to time. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll be all right. He's quite clever, you know...for a human being.
===	===
HAN	Take it easy.
C-3PO	Excuse us, please.
===	===
SENIOR CONTROLLER	No. Wait -- there's something very weak coming through.
C-3PO	Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code.
===	===
HAN	No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. right?
C-3PO	Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand? And...do take care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear.
===	===
HAN	Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm going to get you to your ship.
C-3PO	Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our only hope.
HEAD CONTROLLER	K-one-zero...all troops disengage.
C-3PO	Oh! Wait for me!
===	===
HAN	Transport, this is Solo. Better take off -- I can't get to you. I'll get the princess out on the Falcon.
C-3PO	But...but...but...where are you going? Uh...come back!!
===	===
HAN	Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a permanent resident!
C-3PO	Wait! Wait!
===	===
HAN	It might.
C-3PO	Captain Solo, Captain Solo...sir, might I suggest that you... It can wait.
===	===
HAN	Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us.
C-3PO	Sir, sir! Might I suggest...
===	===
HAN	Prepare to make the jump to light-speed.
C-3PO	But, sir!
HAN	I think we're in trouble.
C-3PO	If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed!
===	===
LEIA	You don't have to do this to impress me.
C-3PO	Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one.
===	===
HAN	I'm not going to argue with that.
C-3PO	Pulverized?
LEIA	Closer?
C-3PO	Closer?!
===	===
HAN	Yeah. That'll do nicely.
C-3PO	Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going?
===	===
HAN	I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.
C-3PO	Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but...does that include shutting me down, too?
HAN	No, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.
C-3PO	Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable.
HAN	Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these things.  Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive.
C-3PO	Oh! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most...
===	===
LEIA	No, you're not. You're...
C-3PO	Sir, sir! I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling.
HAN	Thank you. Thank you very much.
C-3PO	Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.
===	===
LEIA	Outside, in the cave.
C-3PO	There it is. Listen! Listen!
LEIA	Then I'm going with you.
C-3PO	I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. (hears another mysterious noise) Oh, no.
===	===
HAN	Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more.
C-3PO	Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly thing. Shoo! Shoo!
===	===
HAN	Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off!
C-3PO	Look!
HAN	I see it, I see it.
C-3PO	We're doomed!
===	===
HAN	It's not my fault.
C-3PO	Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
LEIA	You're going to attack them?!
C-3PO	Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial Star Destroyer...
===	===
HAN	The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw.
C-3PO	I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough...
===	===
INTERCOM VOICE	You will not deviate from your present course.
C-3PO	Rather touchy, aren't they?
===	===
HAN	Well, what would you like?
C-3PO	Well, they did let us land.
===	===
HAN	All right, all right, you old smoothie.
C-3PO	Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My facilities are at your... Well, really!
===	===
LANDO	Yeah, I'm responsible these days. It's the price you pay for being successful.
C-3PO	Oh! Nice to see a familiar face.
SECOND THREEPIO	E chu ta!
C-3PO	How rude!
===	===
MAN	Who are you?
C-3PO	Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I...I didn't mean to intrude. No, no, please don't get up. No!
===	===
ANAKIN	The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in!
C-3PO	Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...!
HAN	Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop!
C-3PO	Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die.
HAN	I know.
C-3PO	What...what's going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see. Oh...they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected -- if he survives the freezing process, that is.
===	===
LANDO	We're getting out of here.
C-3PO	I knew all along it had to be a mistake.
LANDO	I had no choice...
C-3PO	What are you doing? Trust him, trust him!
LEIA	What?
C-3PO	It sounds like Han.
LEIA	Chewie.
C-3PO	I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all, he's only a Wookiee.
===	===
LANDO	The security codes has been changed!
C-3PO	Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security system.
LANDO	Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has takes control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive. This way.
C-3PO	Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal.
