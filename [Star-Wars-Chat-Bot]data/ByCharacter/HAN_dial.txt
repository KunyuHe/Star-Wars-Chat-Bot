Yes, indeed.  If it's a fast ship.
Fast ship?  You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?
Should I have?
It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs! I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.  I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.  She's fast enough for you, old man.  What's the cargo?
Only passengers.  Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked.
What is it?  Some kind of local trouble?
Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.
Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?  And it's going to cost you something extra.  Ten thousand in advance.
Ten thousand?  We could almost buy our own ship for that!
But who's going to fly it, kid! You?
We haven't that much with us. But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.
Seventeen, huh! Okay.  You guys got yourself a ship.  We'll leave as soon as you're ready.  Docking bay Ninety-four.
Ninety-four.
Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.
All right, we'll check it out.
Seventeen thousand!  Those guys must really be desperate.  This could really save my neck.  Get back to the ship and get her ready.
Going somewhere, Solo?
Yes, Greedo.  As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money.
It's too late.  You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.  I'm lucky I found you first.
Yeah, but this time I got the money.
If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.
I don't have it with me.  Tell Jabba...
Jabba's through with you.  He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.
Even I get boarded sometimes.  Do you think I had a choice?
You can tell that to Jabba.  He may only take your ship.
Over my dead body.
That's the idea I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time.
Yes, I'll bet you have. Sorry about the mess.
Come on out, Solo!
I've been waiting for you, Jabba.
I expected you would be.
I'm not the type to run.
Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me... why haven't you paid me?  And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that... after all we've been through together.
You sent Greedo to blast me.
Han, why you're the best smuggler in the business.  You're too valuable to fry.  He was only relaying my concern at your delays.  He wasn't going to blast you.
I think he thought he was.  Next time don't send one of those twerps. If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself.
Han, Han!  If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can't make an exception.  Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship?  It's not good business.
You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.  I had no choice, but I've got a charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra.  I just need some more time.
Put your blasters away.  Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you.  So, for an extra, say... twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but this is it.  If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.
Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my pleasure.
What a piece of junk.
She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.  She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.  I've added some special modifications myself. We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here.
Why don't you outrun them?  I thought you said this thing was fast.
Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home.  We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!
How long before you can make the jump to light speed?
It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi- computer.
Are you kidding?  At the rate they're gaining...
Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!  Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?
What's that flashing?
We're losing our deflector shield. Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed.
I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.  I fear something terrible has happened. You'd better get on with your exercises.
Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.  I told you I'd outrun 'em. Don't everyone thank me at once. Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.
Now be careful, Artoo. He made a fair move.  Screaming about it won't help you.
Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.
That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose.  Wookiees are known to do that.
Partially. But it also obeys your commands.
Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.
You don't believe in the Force, do you?
Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.  I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
Your eyes can deceive you.  Don't trust them. Stretch out with your feelings. You see, you can do it.
I call it luck.
In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.
Look, going good against remotes is one thing.  Going good against the living?  That's something else. Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.
What's going on?
Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!
What do you mean?  Where is it?
Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid.  It ain't there.  It's been totally blown away.
Destroyed... by the Empire!
The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.  It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've... There's another ship coming in.
No.  It's a short range fighter.
There aren't any bases around here.  Where did it come from?
It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in big trouble.
Not if I can help it.  Chewie... jam it's transmissions.
It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range.
Not for long...
Then he must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something...
Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.
Look at him.  He's heading for that small moon.
I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.
That's no moon!  It's a space station.
It's too big to be a space station.
Turn the ship around!
Yeah, I think your right.  Full reverse!  Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
Why are we still moving towards it?
We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in!
But there's gotta be something you can do!
There's nothin' I can do about it, kid.  I'm in full power.  I'm going to have to shut down.  But they're not going to get me without a fight!
Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.
I use them for smuggling.  I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them.  This is ridiculous.  Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam.
Leave that to me!
Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!
The ship's all yours.  If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately.  All right, let's go.
Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this?
You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.
Bring them on!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone.
Whatever you say.  I've done more than I bargained for on this trip already.
They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.  Your destiny lies along a different path from mine.  The Force will be with you ... always!
Boy you said it, Chewie. Where did you dig up that old fossil?
Ben is a great man.
Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.
I didn't hear you give any ideas...
Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for them to pick us up...
The princess?  She's here?
Princess?
Where... where is she?
Princess?  What's going on?
Oh, no!  We've got to do something.
What are you talking about?
The droid belongs to her.  She's the one in the message.  We've got to help her.
Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.  The old man wants us to wait right here.
But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?
I'm not going anywhere.
They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured.  Now all you want to do is stay.
Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.
But they're going to kill her!
Better her than me...
She's rich.
Rich?
Yes.  Rich, powerful!  Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...
What?
Well more wealth that you can imagine.
I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!
You'll get it!
I better!
You will...
All right, kid.  But you'd better be right about this!
All right.
What's your plan?
Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders there will you? Okay.  Now, I'm going to put these on you. Okay.  Han, you put these on.
Don't worry, Chewie.  I think I know what he has in mind.
Lock the door!
And hope they don't have blasters.
Why didn't you say so before?
I did say so before!
I wasn't notified.  I'll have to clear it.
Look out!  He's loose!
He's going to pull us all apart.
Go get him! We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in. Here it is... cell twenty-one- eight-seven.  You go get her.  I'll hold them here. Everything is under control. Situation normal.
What happened?
Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction.  But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now.  We're fine.  We're all fine here, now, thank you.  How are you?
We're sending a squad up.
Uh, uh, negative, negative.  We had a reactor leak here now.  Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak... very dangerous.
Who is this?  What's your operating number?
Boring conversation anyway. Luke!  We're going to have company!
Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness.
There isn't any other way out.
I can't hold them off forever! Now what?
This is some rescue.  When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?
He's the brains, sweetheart.
Well, I didn't...
What the hell are you doing?
Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise guy.
Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell!  Get in there and don't worry about it. Wonderful girl!  Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.  Get in there!
Put that thing away!  You're going to get us all killed.
Absolutely, Your Worship.  Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here.  You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.
It could be worse...
It's worse.
There's something alive in here!
That's your imagination.
Something just moves past my leg! Look!  Did you see that?
What?
Help!
Luke!  Luke!  Luke!
Blast it, will you!  My gun's jammed.
Where?
Anywhere!  Oh!!
Luke!  Luke!
I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared...
I've got a very bad feeling about this.
Threepio!  Come in, Threepio! Threepio!
Get to the top!
Well, let's get moving!
Where are you going?
No, wait.  They'll hear!
Come here, you big coward! Chewie!  Come here!
Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you.  Okay?
Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight!  I take orders from one person!  Me!
It's a wonder you're still alive. Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?
No reward is worth this.
You came in that thing?  You're braver that I thought.
Nice!  Come on!
It's them!  Blast them!
Get back to the ship!
Is the ship all right?
Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission.
No!
Come on!
Come on!  Luke, its too late!
Blast the door!  Kid!
There wasn't anything you could have done.
Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet!
We've lost lateral controls.
Don't worry, she'll hold together. You hear me, baby?  Hold together!
Got him!  I got him!
Great kid!  Don't get cocky.
That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, they let us go.  It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.
Easy... you call that easy?
Their tracking us!
Not this ship, sister.
At least the information in Artoo is still intact.
What's so important?  What's he carrying?
The technical readouts of that battle station.  I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found.  It's not over yet!
It is for me, sister!  Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess.  I expect to be well paid.  I'm in it for the money!
I care! So... what do you think of her, Han?
I'm trying not to, kid!
Good...
Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me...
So... you got your reward and you're just leaving then?
That's right, yeah!  I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff.  Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you?  Why don't you come with us?  You're pretty good in a fight.  I could use you.
Come on!  Why don't you take a look around?  You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.
What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?  Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage.  It's more like suicide.
All right.  Well, take care of yourself, Han... guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?
Hey, Luke... may the Force be with you! What're you lookin' at?  I know what I'm doing.
Luke!  Luke!  Luke!
Hey!  Hey!
I knew you'd come back!  I just knew it!
Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the reward.
Just relax for a moment. You're free of the carbonite. Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
I can't see.
You eyesight will return in time.
Where am I?
Jabba's palace.
Who are you?
Someone who loves you.
Leia!
I gotta get you out of here.
What's that? I know that laugh. Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault.
It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but now you're Bantha fodder.
Look...
Take him away!
Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be a fool!
Han!
Luke!
Are you all right?
Fine. Together again, huh?
Wouldn't miss it.
How are we doing?
The same as always.
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
Good, I hate long waits.
You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.
Doesn't sound so bad.
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
Oh... great!
Han! Chewie?
Lando! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
Lower it!
I'm trying! Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping. Grab it! L--Lando. Grab! Grab it! Almost... You almost got it!
Hold it! Whoa!
Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie. Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!
That's all any of us can see.
Then I guess I'm getting better. I've got to hand it to you, kid, you were pretty good out there.
I had a lot of help. Think nothing of it.
No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest thing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide awake nothing!
I'll see you back at the fleet.
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
(looking dubiously at Lando, obviously remembering his friend's betrayal and subsequent aide) Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
I will.
Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one.
Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack.
I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.
Well, who says they didn't.  But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember?
You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor. General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack
Good luck. You're gonna need it.
General Solo, is your strike team assembled?
Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle. Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you. That's one.
Ask me again sometime.
Luke.
All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?
Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch.
Look, would you get going, you pirate. Good luck.
You, too.
Yeah, she's comin' up.
No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
Hey, are you awake?
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
Come on, General, let's move.
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
Here we go again.
All right, hang on.
We have you on our screen now. Please identify.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.
Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage.
Transmission commencing.
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
It'll work. It'll work.
Vader's on that ship.
Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance. I don't know.  Fly casual.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.
Shuttle Tydirium, deactivation of the shield will commence immediately. Follow your present course.
Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.
Shall we try and go around?
It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
Hey... it's me.
I see them. Wait, Leia! Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch!
Hey, wait! Ahhh!
Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!
Luke! Where's Leia?
What? She didn't come back?
I thought she was with you.
We got separated. Hey, we better go look for her.
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.
I hope she's alright. What, Chewie? What? Chewie!
Chewie, wa-wait!  Don't!
Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. (trying to free an arm) Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
Yeah, sure.
Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-op!!
Wha--?  Hey!  Point that thing someplace else. Hey!
Oh, yes, Master Luke!  Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication.
What are you telling them?
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
Proper?!
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
Why, you-- My mistake. He's an old friend of mine.
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
Leia!
But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free.
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that.
What's going on?
Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.
Just what I always wanted. Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie. (to Wicket) Thank you. Okay.
He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator.
Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back. And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day.
Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.
Hey, what's goin' on?
Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.
Nothing?  Come on, tell me.  What's goin' on?
I...I can't tell you.
Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?
I...
Ahhh... I'm sorry.
The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm.
Then we'll do it real quiet-like.
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
Charges!  Come on, come on!
The code's changed. We need Artoo!
Here's the terminal.
We're coming!
Come on! Come on!
Oh, Artoo, hurry! My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
Let's see.
Don't move!
I love you.
Hands up! Stand up!
Stay back. Chewie!  Get down here!  She's wounded!  No, wait....  I got an idea.
Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you read me?
Loud and clear, kid. What's up?
Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. The sensors are placed. I'm going back.
Solo?
No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place. You'll know if anything comes around.
Commander Skywalker reported in yet?
No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
General, I've got to leave. I can't stay anymore.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut, I'm a dead man.
A death mark's not an easy thing to live with. You're a good fighter, Solo. I hate to lose you.
Thank you, General. Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it.
That's right.
Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess.
Han!
Yes, Your Highnessness?
I thought you decided to stay.
Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
Han, we need you!
We?
Yes.
Oh, what about you need?
I need? I don't know what you're talking about.
You probably don't.
And what precisely am I supposed to know?
Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader...
No! That's not it. Come on. Aahhh -- uh huh! Come on.
You're imagining things.
Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?
I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.
I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!
Excuse me, sir.
Put them back together right now.
Might I have a word with you, please?
What do you want?
Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator.
I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.
Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is.
I don't know where he is.
Nobody knows where he is.
What do you mean, "nobody knows"?
Well, uh, you see...
Deck Officer. Deck Officer!
Yes, sir?
Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?
I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in through the south entrance.
It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out there.
Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on?
Why not?
Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't come in through the south entrance. He might have forgotten to check in.
Not likely. Are the speeders ready?
Not yet. We're having some trouble adapting them to the cold.
Then we'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
Sir, the temperature's dropping too rapidly.
That's right. And my friends out in it.
Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you reach the first marker.
Then I'll see you in hell!
Ben...Ben.
Luke! Luke! Don't do this, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here. Not much time.
Ben...Ben...
Hang on, kid.
Dagobah system...
Whew...
Dagobah...
This may smell bad, kid...
Yoda...
...but it will keep you warm...til I get the shelter built. (struggling to get Luke in the carcass) Ooh...I thought they smelled bad on the outside!
This is Rouge Two. this is Rouge Two. Captain Solo, so you copy? Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rouge Two.
Good morning. Nice of you guys to drop by.
Master Luke, sir, it's good to see you fully functional again. Artoo expresses his relief, also.
How are you feeling, kid? You don't look so bad to me. In fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark.
Thanks to you.
That's two you owe me, junior. Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer.
I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield.
That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.
I don't know where you get you delusions, laser brain.
Laugh it up, fuzz ball. But you didn't see us alone in the south passage. She expressed her true feelings for me.
My...! Why, you stuck up,...half-witted,...scruffy-looking... nerf-herder!
Who's scruffy-looking?  I must have hit her pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?
Headquarters personnel, report to command center.
Take it easy.
Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke.
It could be a speeder, one of ours.
Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code.
It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let's check it out.
What was it?
Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct.
An Imperial probe droid.
It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here.
Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?
Hi, kid.  There's got to be a reason for it. Check it at the other end. Wait a second. (to Luke) You all right?
Yeah.
Be careful.
Why are you still here?
I heard the command center had been hit.
You got your clearance to leave.
Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm going to get you to your ship.
Imperial troops have entered the base.
Come on...that's it.
Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop! How typical.
Come on.
Would it helped if I got out and pushed?
It might.
The bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
This baby's got a few surprises left in her, sweetheart.
Someday you're going to be wrong, and I hope I'm there to see it.
Punch it!
Saw what?
Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us.
Sir, sir! Might I suggest...
Shut him up or shut him down!  Check the deflector shield! Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them.
They're getting closer!
Oh yeah? Watch this.
Watch what?
I think we're in trouble.
If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed!
We're in trouble!
Han, get up here!
Come on, Chewie!
Asteroids!
Oh, no! Chewie, set two-seven-one.
What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid field?
They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?
Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one.
Never tell me the odds!
I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
I'm not going to argue with that.
Pulverized?
I'm going in closer to one of the big ones.
Oh, this is suicide!
There. That looks pretty good.
What looks pretty good?
Yeah. That'll do nicely.
I hope you know what you're doing.
Yeah, me too.
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but...does that include shutting me down, too?
No, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.
Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable.
Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these things.  Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive.
Let go.
Sshh!
Let go, please.
Don't get excited.
Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited.
Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else.
Oh, where is Artoo when I need him? Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.
Well, of course I'll have to replace it. Here! And Chewie... ...I think we'd better replace the negative power coupling. Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help.
Would you please stop calling me that?
Sure, Leia.
Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes.
I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though. (he watches her reaction) Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right.
Occasionally  maybe...when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that.
Stop that.
Stop what?
Stop that! My hands are dirty.
My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of?
Afraid?
You're trembling.
I'm not trembling.
You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life.
I happen to like nice men.
I'm a nice man.
Sir, sir! I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Sir, if I may venture an opinion...
I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio.
There's something out there.
Where?
There it is. Listen! Listen!
I'm going out there.
Are you crazy?!
I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let something tear it apart.
This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock at all.
There's an awful lot of moisture in here.
I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this.
Yeah. Watch out! Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables.
Mynocks?
Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more.
Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly thing. Shoo! Shoo!
Wait a minute...
The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to...
No time to discuss this as a committee.
You can't make the jump to light-speed in this asteroid field...
Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off!
Look!
I see it, I see it.
The cave is collapsing.
This is no cave.
No light-speed?
It's not my fault.
Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
Turn her around. I said turn her around! I'm going to put all power in the front shield.
Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. (Chewie growls) No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me?
The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw.
I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough...
Thank you.
What did you have in mind for your next move?
Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away.
With the rest of the garbage. Then what?
Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any ideas?
No. Where are we?
The Anoat system.
Anoat system. There's not much there.
No. Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando.
Lando system?
Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian. He's a card player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him.
Thanks.
Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it.
A mining colony?
Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me.
Can you trust him?
No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that. Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach!
I thought you knew this person.
Well, that was a long time ago. I'm sure he's forgotten about that.
Permission granted to land on Platform Three-two-seven.
Thank you. There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me.
I don't like this.
Well, what would you like?
Well, they did let us land.
Look, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Trust me.
What are you doing here?
Ahh...repairs. I thought you could help me out.
What have you done to my ship?
Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square.
Welcome, Leia.
All right, all right, you old smoothie.
What's wrong with the Falcon?
Hyperdrive.
I'll get my people to work on it.
Good.
Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties...(catches Han grinning at him) What's so funny?
You. Listen to you -- you sound like a businessman, a responsible leader. Who'd have thought that, huh?
You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things.
Yeah.
The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost.
Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out.
I don't trust Lando.
Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides, we'll soon be gone.
What happened?
Where? Found him in a junk pile?
Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
Lando's got people who can fix him.
Will you join me for a little refreshment? Everyone's invited, of course. Having trouble with you droid?
No. No problem. Why?
No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be noticed...which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves.
Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down?
I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, too.
Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not right because now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough...
I feel terrible.
Why are they doing this?
They never even asked me any questions.
Lando.
Get out of here, Lando!
Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.
Over to you?
He doesn't want you at all. He's after somebody called Skywalker.
Luke?
Well, he's on his way.
Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you? My friend!
Stop! I've done all I can do. I'm sorry I couldn't do better, but I have my own problems.
Yeah, you're a real hero.
If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish.
What's going on...buddy?
Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...!
Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop!
Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die.
Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey! Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess -- you have to take care of her. You hear me?
I love you!
I know.
