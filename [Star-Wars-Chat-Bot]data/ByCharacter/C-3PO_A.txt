it couldcan not possibly be as bad as all that well there i agree with you in fact i could do with a tuneup myself
is there anything i might do for you my lady
my lady are you   are you all right
what is going on you  had be anymore confused than i am
something important is going on i heard a rumor they are going to banish all droids shhhhhh   not so loud whatever it is we have be the last to know
well he is under a lot of stress artoo take care my little friend my lady is there anything i might do
i feel so helpless
yes   right after the attack on the jedi temple
oh dear
it s some kind of reproductive process i think
oh no
oh my  oh my master anakin my goodness i can hardly believe it and this must be miss padme
oh dear ilet us so terribly sorry master annie
i think we is better go inside
that will something i cannot relate to as a protocol droid ilet us either active or inactive there will no inbetween
do you really think so i suppose i shouldcan not expect 
oh ilet us not unhappy  and my masters here ar so kind i wouldcan not wish to trouuble them it will just  being like this  well it will embarrassing
naked if you pardon the expression you see when master annie made me he never quite found the time to give me any outer covering it will so humiliating how would you like it if you had to go around with all your circuits showing
of course you wouldcan not nobody would it will simply not protocol
i docan not think so only master annie 
oh how observant of you miss padme of course ilet us just not mechanically minded  if you see what i mean
ooooh that will tickles
um how do i look
perfect oh miss padme ilet us so happy oh pardon me thank you thank you thank you thank you
oh my
yes it is artoo most confusing one moment they am generating a pleasant mutual attraction and the next waves of violent hostility even though ilet us programmed to understand them i doubt if i ever shall
sir  not in an environment such as this  that will why i are also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that 
vaporators  sir  my first job was programming binary load lifters   very similar to your vaporators you could say 
of course i can sir  it will like a second language for me   ilet us as fluent in bocce 
shutting up sir
excuse me sir but that r2 unit is in prime condition  a real bargain
uh ilet us quite sure you have be very pleased with that one sir  he really is in firstclass condition i are worked with him before  here he comes
now docan not forget this  why i should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity
is there anything i might do to help
i docan not think so sir  ilet us only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things  not on this planet anyways  as a matter of fact ilet us not even sure which planet ilet us on
i see sir
i see sir luke
and i am seethreepio humancyborg relations and this is my counterpart artoodetoo
with all we are been through sometimes ilet us amazed we am in as good condition as we are what with the rebellion and all
that will how we came to be in your service if you take my meaning sir
several i think  actually there will not much to tell  ilet us not much more than an interpreter and not very good at telling stories well not at making them interesting anyways
what is what  he asked you a question  what is that
oh he says it will nothing sir merely a malfunction  old data pay it no mind
ilet us afraid ilet us not quite sure sir
i think she was a passenger on our last voyage  a person of some importance sir  i believe  our captain was attached to 
behave yourself artoo  you am going to get us in trouble it will all right you can trust him  he will our new master he says he will the property of obi wan kenobi a resident of these parts  and it will a private message for him  quite frankly sir i docan not know what he will talking about  our last master was captain antilles but with what we are been through this little r2 unit has become a bit eccentric
i beg your pardon sir but do you know what he will talking about
he says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system  he suggests that if you remove the bolt he might be able to play back the entire recording
what message  the one you√ïve just been playing  the one you am carrying inside your rusty innards
ilet us sorry sir but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter
just you reconsider playing that message for him no i docan not think he likes you at all no i docan not like you either
it wascan not my fault sir  please docan not deactivate me  i told him not to go but he will faulty malfunctioning kept babbling on about his mission
pardon me sir but couldcan not we go after him
oh he excels at that sir
sir would it help if you told him it was my fault
deactivate  well on the other hand if you hadcan not removed his restraining bolt 
master luke here is your rightful owner  we have have no more of this obiwan kenobi jibberish  and docan not talk to me of your mission either you am fortunate he doescan not blast you into a million pieces right here
if you docan not mind my saying so sir i think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you are gotten him back to your workshop
oh my  sir he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast
i docan not think i can make it  you go on master luke  there will no sense in you risking yourself on my account  ilet us done for
sir if you have not be needing me i have close down for awhile
come along artoo
i heartily agree with you sir
i would much rather have gone with master luke than stay here with you  i docan not know what all this trouble is about but ilet us sure it must be your fault you watch your language
oh my  i is forgotten how much i hate space travel
now be careful artoo he made a fair move  screaming about it will not help you
but sir nobody worries about upsetting a droid
i see your point sir  i suggest a new strategy artoo  let the wookiee win
we found the computer outlet sir
he says he will found the main control to the power beam that will holding the ship here  he have try to make the precise location appear on the monitor the tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations a power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave
ilet us afraid ilet us not quite sure sir he says  i found her  and keeps repeating  she will here 
princess leia
level five detention block aa twentythree  ilet us afraid she will scheduled to be terminated
master luke sir  pardon me for asking  but ah  what should artoo and i do if we am discovered here
that iscan not very reassuring
yes sir
oh no
they am madmen  they am heading for the prison level  if you hurry you might catch them
come on oh  all this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here  if you docan not mind i is like to take him down to maintenance
no  shut them all down  hurry listen to them  they am dying artoo  curse my metal body  i wascan not fast enough  it will all my fault  my poor master
for the moment  uh we am in the main hangar across from the ship
hang on tight artoo you are got to come back you wouldcan not want my life to get boring would you
oh my  artoo  can you hear me say something you can repair him  had you
you must repair him  sir if any of my circuits or gears will help i have gladly donate them
goodness gracious me artoo detoowha bo seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka jabba du hutt i docan not think they am going to let us in artoo we is better go artoo wait oh dear artoo artoo i really docan not think we should rush into all this oh artoo  artoo wait for me
oh my die wanna wauaga we   we bring a message to your master jabba the hutt   and a gift thinks a moment then to artoo gift what gift
he says that our instructions are to give it only to jabba himself ilet us terribly sorry ilet us afraid he will ever so stubborn about these sort of things
artoo i have a bad feeling about this
the message artoo the message
what did he say
this  had be artoo you am playing the wrong message
we am doomed
artoo look captain solo and he will still frozen in carbonite
i am seethreepio humancy 
oh well yes
i am fluent in over six million forms of communication and can readily 
disintegrated
artoo docan not leave me ohhh
oh no chewbacca
oh uh yes uh i am here your worshipfulness uh  yes oh the illustrious jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty five thousand
uh oh  but what what did i say to boushh uh the mighty jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand because he will holding a thermal detonator
jabba offers the sum of thirtyfive and i suggest you take it
he agrees
ohhh i  had bear to watch
master luke you am standing on 
oh dear his high exaltedness the great jabba the hutt has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately
you will therefore be taken to the dune sea and cast into the pit of carkoon the nesting place of the allpowerful sarlacc
in his belly you will find a new definition of pain and suffering as you are slowly digested over a thousand years
oh ilet us terribly sor  artoo what are you doing here well i can see you am serving drinks but this place is dangerous they am going to execute master luke and if we am not careful us too hmm  i wish i had your confidence
not my eyes artoo help quickly artoo oh ohhh you beast

sounds dangerous
exciting is hardly the word i would use

ilet us afraid that artoo will sensors can find no trace of princess leia
artoo ilet us not sure that will such a good idea it will a very long drooop
oh my head oh my goodness
oh yes master luke  remember that i am fluent in over six million forms of communication
hello i think  i could be mistaken they am using a very primitive dialect  but i do believe they think i am some sort of god
i beg your pardon general solo but that just wouldcan not be proper
it will against my programming to impersonate a deity
ilet us rather embarrassed general solo but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor
your royal highness
but master luke what magic couldcan not possibly  
you see master luke they didcan not believe me just    as i said they wouldcan not whawhawhat will happening oh oh dear oh put me down heeelp master luke artoo somebody somebody help master luke artoo artoo quickly do something somebody oh ohhh oh oh oh oh thank goodness

excuse me sir might i inquire what will going on
impossible man come along artoo lets find princess leia between ourselves i think master luke is in considerable danger
mistress leia artoo says he will been quite unable to pick up any signals although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope
artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventyfive to one actually artoo has been known to make mistakes from time to time oh dear oh dear docan not worry about master luke ilet us sure he have be all right he will quite clever you know for a human being
excuse us please
sir i am fluent in six million forms of communication this signal is not used by the alliance it could be an imperial code

oh wait for me
but but but where are you going uh come back
wait wait
captain solo captain solo sir might i suggest that you  it can wait
sir sir might i suggest 
but sir
if i may say so sir i noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged it will impossible to go to lightspeed
sir the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand seven hundred and twenty to one
pulverized
closer
excuse me ma am but where are we going
sir ilet us almost afraid to ask but does that include shutting me down too
sir it will quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable
oh sometimes i just docan not understand human behavior after all ilet us only trying to do my job in the most 
sir sir i are isolated the reverse power flux coupling
oh you am perfectly welcome sir
there it is listen listen
i think it might be better if i stay here and guard the ship hears another mysterious noise oh no
ohhh go away go away beastly thing shoo shoo
look
we am doomed
sir we just lost the main rear deflector shield one more direct hit on the back quarter and we am done for
sir the odds of surviving a direct assault on an imperial star destroyer 
i really docan not see how thats going to help surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances the empire may be gracious enough 
rather touchy arecan not they
well they did let us land
hello sir i am seethreepio humancyborg relations my facilities are at your  well really
oh nice to see a familiar face
how rude
oh ilet us terribly sorry i i didcan not mean to intrude no no please docan not get up no
oh no no no no stop chewbacca stop 
yes stop please ilet us not ready to die
what what will going on turn around chewbacca i  had see oh they are encased him in carbonite he should be quite wellprotected   if he survives the freezing process that is
i knew all along it had to be a mistake
what are you doing trust him trust him
it sounds like han
ilet us terribly sorry about all this after all he will only a wookiee
artoo you can tell the computer to override the security system
docan not blame me ilet us an interpreter ilet us not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal
