Don't play games with me, Your Highness.  You weren't on any mercy mission this time.  You passed directly through a restricted system.  Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...
Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good.  Were you on a starcruiser or...
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.
What is what?!?  He asked you a question... What is that?
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...
I seem to have found it.
General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.  Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.  I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.  I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit.  My father will know how to retrieve it.  You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.  This is our most desperate hour.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.
We've entered the Alderaan system.
Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash.  I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.
Charming to the last.  You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!
IÃ•m surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself!
Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational.  No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.
The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.  In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan.
No!  Alderaan is peaceful.  We have no weapons.  You can't possibly...
You would prefer another target? A military target?  Then name the system! I grow tired of asking this.  So it'll be the last time.  Where is the Rebel base?
Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.
There.  You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation.  You may fire when ready.
What?
You're far too trusting.  Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration.  But don't worry. We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough.
No!
What?  Oh... the uniform.  I'm Luke Skywalker.  I'm here to rescue you.
You're who?
I'm here to rescue you.  I've got your R2 unit.  I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
Ben Kenobi is here!  Where is he?
Chewie! Get behind me!  Get behind me! Can't get out that way.
Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.
I can't hold them off forever! Now what?
This is some rescue.  When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?
What the hell are you doing?
Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise guy.
No!  wait! Will you forget it?  I already tried it.  It's magnetically sealed!
Put that thing away!  You're going to get us all killed.
Absolutely, Your Worship.  Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here.  You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.
It could be worse...
Luke!  Luke!  Luke!
Luke! Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.
Luke!  Luke!
Grab him! What happened?
The walls are moving!
Don't just stand there.  Try and brace it with something.
Get to the top!
I can't
One thing's for sure.  We're all going to be a lot thinner! Get on top of it!
I'm trying!
Where are you going?
No, wait.  They'll hear!
Come here, you big coward! Chewie!  Come here!
Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you.  Okay?
Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight!  I take orders from one person!  Me!
It's a wonder you're still alive. Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?
We're right above you.  Stand by.
You came in that thing?  You're braver that I thought.
Where are you going?  Come back!
He certainly has courage.
I think we took a wrong turn.
There's no lock!
That oughta hold it for a while.
Quick, we've got to get across. Find the control that extends the bridge.
Oh, I think I just blasted it.
They're coming through!
Here, hold this.
Here they come! For luck!
Didn't we just leave this party? What kept you?
We ran into some old friends.
Come on!
Come on!  Luke, its too late!
I can't believe he's gone.
There wasn't anything you could have done.
That's it!  We did it!
We did it!
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I even amaze myself.
That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, they let us go.  It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.
Easy... you call that easy?
Their tracking us!
Not this ship, sister.
At least the information in Artoo is still intact.
What's so important?  What's he carrying?
The technical readouts of that battle station.  I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found.  It's not over yet!
It is for me, sister!  Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess.  I expect to be well paid.  I'm in it for the money!
You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive! Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anyone.
You're safe!  We had feared the worst. When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... lost along with your father.
We don't have time for our sorrows, commander.  The battle station has surely tracked us here. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.  You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack.  It is our only hope.
Oh, it's Han!  I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind.
He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him.
Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the reward.
Hey, I knew there was more to you than money.
Who are you?
Someone who loves you.
Leia!
I gotta get you out of here.
Bring her to me.
We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this...
I'm sure.
Ugh!
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
I'm here.
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
That's all any of us can see.
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
He means "You're welcome."
I'll meet you back at the fleet.
Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now.
Sounds dangerous.
I wonder who they found to pull that off.
Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle. Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you. That's one.
Uh, General... count me in.
I'm with you, too!
What is it?
No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
Hey, are you awake?
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
Come on, General, let's move.
Transmission commencing.
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
Oh, I told you it was dangerous here.
Shall we try and go around?
Great. Come on.
Over there! Two more of them!
Freeze!  Come on, get up! Go get your ride and take her back to base. Yes, sir.
Come on, let's get outta here.
Leia!
Oh!
Your Royal Highness.
But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
What do you remember?
Just...images, really. Feelings.
Tell me.
(a little surprised at his insistence) She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. (looks up) Why are you asking me all this?
I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
Vader is here...now, on this moon.
How do you know?
I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. (facing her) As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here. (beat) I have to face him.
Why?
He's my father.
Your father?
There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it. Yes. It's you Leia.
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
Then you know why I have to face him.
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
But, why must you confront him?
Hey, what's goin' on?
Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.
Nothing?  Come on, tell me.  What's goin' on?
I...I can't tell you.
Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?
I...
Ahhh... I'm sorry.
Hold me.
Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
What's he saying?
Back door, huh? Good idea. It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble.
Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm.
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
Quiet.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
Oh, no.
All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie.
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
We surrender. Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo.
The code's changed. We need Artoo!
Here's the terminal.
Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away.
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
I'll cover you.
Let's see.
It's not bad.
I love you.
I know.
Thank you, General. Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it.
That's right.
Yes, Your Highnessness?
I thought you decided to stay.
Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
Han, we need you!
We?
Yes.
Oh, what about you need?
I need? I don't know what you're talking about.
You probably don't.
And what precisely am I supposed to know?
Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader...
No! That's not it. Come on. Aahhh -- uh huh! Come on.
You're imagining things.
Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?
I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.
That's two you owe me, junior. Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer.
I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield.
That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.
I don't know where you get you delusions, laser brain.
Laugh it up, fuzz ball. But you didn't see us alone in the south passage. She expressed her true feelings for me.
My...! Why, you stuck up,...half-witted,...scruffy-looking... nerf-herder!
Who's scruffy-looking?  I must have hit her pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?
Why, I guess you don't know everything about women yet?
It's metal.
Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke.
Afraid there's not much left.
What was it?
Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct.
An Imperial probe droid.
Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?
The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path. When you've gotten past the energy shield, proceed directly to the rendezvous point. Understood?
Right. Okay.
Good luck.
I don't think we can protect two transports at a time.
It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no choice.
Launch patrols.
Evacuate remaining ground staff.
You all right?
Why are you still here?
I heard the command center had been hit.
You got your clearance to leave.
Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our only hope.
Send all troops in sector twelve to the south slope to protect the fighters.
Come on...that's it.
Give the evacuation code signal. And get to your transports!
How's this?
Would it helped if I got out and pushed?
Come on! Come on! Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a burnout. See?
Someday you're going to be wrong, and I hope I'm there to see it.
I saw them! I saw them!
Saw what?
But, sir!
They're getting closer!
Oh yeah? Watch this.
Watch what?
Horizontal boosters...! Alluvial dampers...! Well that's not it. Bring me the hydrospanners! I don't know how we're going to get out of this one. Oww! Chewie! That was no laser blast! Something hit us.
Han, get up here!
Oh, no! Chewie, set two-seven-one.
What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid field?
They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?
You don't have to do this to impress me.
You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be it, sweetheart.
I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
I'm going in closer to one of the big ones.
Closer?
There. That looks pretty good.
What looks pretty good?
Oh! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most...
Let go.
Sshh!
Let go, please.
Don't get excited.
Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited.
Well, of course I'll have to replace it. Here! And Chewie... ...I think we'd better replace the negative power coupling. Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help.
Would you please stop calling me that?
Sure, Leia.
Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes.
I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though. (he watches her reaction) Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right.
Occasionally  maybe...when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that.
Stop that.
Stop what?
Stop that! My hands are dirty.
My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of?
Afraid?
You're trembling.
I'm not trembling.
You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life.
I happen to like nice men.
I'm a nice man.
No, you're not. You're...
I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio.
There's something out there.
Where?
Outside, in the cave.
I'm going out there.
Are you crazy?!
I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let something tear it apart.
Then I'm going with you.
There's an awful lot of moisture in here.
I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this.
Yeah. Watch out! Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables.
Mynocks?
All right, Chewie, let's get out of here!
The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to...
No time to discuss this as a committee.
I am not a committee!
We're doomed!
The cave is collapsing.
This is no cave.
What?
Let's get out of here. Ready for light-speed? One...two...three! It's not fair! The transfer circuits are working. It's not my fault!
No light-speed?
Turn her around. I said turn her around! I'm going to put all power in the front shield.
You're going to attack them?!
Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial Star Destroyer...
Shut up!
Thank you.
What did you have in mind for your next move?
Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away.
With the rest of the garbage. Then what?
Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any ideas?
No. Where are we?
The Anoat system.
Anoat system. There's not much there.
No. Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando.
Lando system?
Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian. He's a card player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him.
Thanks.
Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it.
A mining colony?
Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me.
Can you trust him?
No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that. Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach!
You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them.
Rather touchy, aren't they?
I thought you knew this person.
Thank you. There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me.
Who's worried?
Oh. No one to meet us.
I don't like this.
Well, he seems very friendly.
Yes...very friendly.
Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm the administrator of this facility. and who might you be?
Leia.
The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're in great shape.
The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost.
Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out.
I don't trust Lando.
Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides, we'll soon be gone.
And then you're as good as gone, aren't you?
Where? Found him in a junk pile?
Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
Lando's got people who can fix him.
No, thanks.
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything?
Not really.
You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds.
Thank you.
So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into the...uh...jurisdiction of the Empire.
So you're part of the mining guild then?
I feel terrible.
Why are they doing this?
They never even asked me any questions.
Lando.
They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
What about Han?
Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter.
Vader wants us all dead.
Lord Vader has set a trap for him.
And we're the bait.
Yeah, you're a real hero.
You certainly have a way with people.
Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey! Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess -- you have to take care of her. You hear me?
I love you!
Well done. Hold them in the security tower -- and keep it quiet. Move.
What do you think you're doing?
I knew all along it had to be a mistake.
Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust you?
What are you doing? Trust him, trust him!
Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice.
I'm just trying to help...
We don't need any of your help.
H-a-a-a...
What?
There's still a chance to save Han...I mean, at the East Platform...
Chewie.
What?
I know where Luke is.
But what about those fighter?
Chewie, just do it.
Look, someone's up there.
It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him. Lando, open the top hatch.
All right, Chewie. Ready for light-speed.
If your people fixed the hyperdrive. All the coordinates are set. It's now or never.
