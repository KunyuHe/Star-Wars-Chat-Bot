chancellor palpatine what a welcome sight are you all right
general grievous will run and hide as he always does he is a coward
then the jedi council will make finding grievous our highest priority
thank you commander anakin deliver this report to the chancellor his reaction will give us a clue to his
i sense a plot to destroy the jedi the dark side of the force surrounds the chancellor
that could be a dangerous move   the jedi council would have to take control of the senate in order to secure a peaceful transition  
what is it skywalker we are in a hurry we have just received word that obiwan has destroyed general grievous we are on our way to make sure the chancellor returns emergency powers back to the senate
a sith lord
how do you know this
are you sure
then our worst fears have been realized we must move quickly if the jedi order is to survive
for your own good stay out of this affair i sense a great deal of confusion in you young skywalker there is much fear that clouds your judgment
no if what you told me is true you will have gained my trust but for now remain here
wait for us in the council chamber until we return
in the name of the galactic senate of the republic you are under arrest chancellor
you are under arrest my lord
you old fool the oppression of the sith will never return your plot to regain control of the republic is over   you have lost  
he will the traitor stop him
aarrrrggghhhhh  
aarrrrggghhhhh  
docan not listen to him anakin
you sith disease i am going to end this once and for all
he has too much control of the senate and the courts he is too dangerous to be kept alive
if they do break away 
but if they do you must realise there arecan not enough jedi to protect the republic we are keepers of the peace not soldiers
what do you sense master
our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners on the moons of naboo
you know m lady count dooku was once a jedi he wouldcan not assassinate anyone it is not in his character
that will possible he has just returned from a border dispute on ansion
i will have obiwan report to you immediately m lady
the propecy is coming true the dark side is growing
it will been ten years and the sith still have no shown themselves do you think they are behind this
do you think obiwan will apprentice will be able to bring balance to the force
there will something else
why
probing the dark side is a dangerous process he could be in seclusion for days  may the force be with you
no whoever placed that order was not a jedi i can assure you
our missing apprentice they are playing their hand at last
be careful obiwan this investigation is becoming less than routine do you need help
we must stop them soon before they am fully ready
patience we should wait for obi wan to report back we docan not know that count dooku has made a treaty with the corporate alliance it will speculation
sorry to disappoint you dooku this party will over
i docan not think so one jedi has to be worth a hundred geonosians
docan not worry it will being  taken care of
we will not be hostages for you to barter with dooku
