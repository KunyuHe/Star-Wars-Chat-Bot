LEIA	Lord Vader, I should have known. Only you could be so bold.  The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...
VADER	Don't play games with me, Your Highness.  You weren't on any mercy mission this time.  You passed directly through a restricted system.  Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
LEIA	I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...
VADER	You're a part of the Rebel Alliance ... and a traitor.  Take her away!
COMMANDER	Holding her is dangerous.  If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate.
VADER	I have traced the Rebel spies to her.  Now she is my only link to find their secret base!
COMMANDER	She'll die before sheÕll tell you anything.
VADER	Leave that to me.  Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!
SECOND OFFICER	Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.
VADER	She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.  Send a detachment down to retrieve them.  See to it personally, Commander.  There'll be no one to stop us this time.
COMMANDER	Yes, sir.
===	===
C-3PO	Thank the maker!  This oil bath is going to feel so good.  I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!
LUKE	It just isn't fair.  Oh, Biggs is right.  I'm never gonna get out of here!
C-3PO	Is there anything I might do to help?
LUKE	Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!
C-3PO	I don't think so, sir.  I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.  Not on this planet, anyways.  As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.
LUKE	Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.
C-3PO	I see, sir.
LUKE	Uh, you can call me Luke.
C-3PO	I see, sir Luke.
LUKE	Just Luke.
C-3PO	And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.
LUKE	Hello. You got a lot of carbon scoring here.  It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.
C-3PO	With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.
LUKE	You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?
C-3PO	That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.
LUKE	Have you been in many battles?
C-3PO	Several, I think.  Actually, there's not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.
LUKE	Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good.  Were you on a starcruiser or...
LEIA	Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.
LUKE	What's this?
C-3PO	What is what?!?  He asked you a question... What is that?
LEIA	Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.
C-3PO	Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction.  Old data. Pay it no mind.
LUKE	Who is she?  She's beautiful.
C-3PO	I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
LEIA	Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...
C-3PO	I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.  A person of some importance, sir - I believe.  Our captain was attached to...
LUKE	Is there more to this recording?
C-3PO	Behave yourself, Artoo.  You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him.  He's our new master. He says he's the property of Obi- Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts.  And it's a private message for him.  Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what he's talking about.  Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.
LUKE	Obi-Wan Kenobi?  I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?
C-3PO	I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?
LUKE	Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea.  He's kind of a strange old hermit. I wonder who she is.  It sounds like she's in trouble.  I'd better play back the whole thing.
C-3PO	He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system.  He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.
LUKE	H'm?  Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off!  Okay. There you go. Well, wait a minute.  Where'd she go?  Bring her back!  Play back the entire message.
C-3PO	What message?  The one youÕve just been playing.  The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards!
AUNT BERU	Luke?  Luke!  Come to dinner!
LUKE	All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.
C-3PO	I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.
LUKE	Well, see what you can do with him.  I'll be right back.
C-3PO	Just you reconsider playing that message for him. No, I don't think he likes you at all. No, I don't like you either.
===	===
LUKE	No, my father didn't fight in the wars.  He was a navigator on a spice freighter.
OBI-WAN	That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals.  Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.
LUKE	You fought in the Clone Wars?
OBI-WAN	Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.
LUKE	I wish I'd known him.
OBI-WAN	He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.  And he was a good friend.  Which reminds me... I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.
C-3PO	Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile.
LUKE	Sure, go ahead. What is it?
OBI-WAN	Your fathers lightsaber.  This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster. An elegant weapon for a more civilized time.  For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.  Before the dark times, before the Empire.
LUKE	How did my father die?
OBI-WAN	A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.  He betrayed and murdered your father.  Now the Jedi are all but extinct.  Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.
LUKE	The Force?
OBI-WAN	Well, the Force is what gives the Jedi his power.  It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend.  And where you come from.
LUKE	I saw part of the message he was...
OBI-WAN	I seem to have found it.
LEIA	General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.  Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.  I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.  I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit.  My father will know how to retrieve it.  You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.  This is our most desperate hour.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.
OBI-WAN	You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.
LUKE	Alderaan?  I'm not going to Alderaan.  I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.
OBI-WAN	I need your help, Luke.  I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. She needs your help.
LUKE	I can't get involved!  I've got work to do!  It's not that I like the Empire.  I hate it!  But there's nothing I can do about it right now.  It's such a long way from here.
OBI-WAN	That's your uncle talking.
LUKE	Oh, God, my uncle.  How am I ever going to explain this?
OBI-WAN	Learn about the Force, Luke.
LUKE	Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.  You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
OBI-WAN	You must do what you feel is right, of course.
===	===
MOTTI	We've entered the Alderaan system.
LEIA	Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash.  I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.
TARKIN	Charming to the last.  You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!
LEIA	IÕm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself!
TARKIN	Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational.  No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.
LEIA	The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
TARKIN	Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.  In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan.
LEIA	No!  Alderaan is peaceful.  We have no weapons.  You can't possibly...
TARKIN	You would prefer another target? A military target?  Then name the system! I grow tired of asking this.  So it'll be the last time.  Where is the Rebel base?
LEIA	Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.
TARKIN	There.  You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation.  You may fire when ready.
LEIA	What?
TARKIN	You're far too trusting.  Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration.  But don't worry. We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough.
LEIA	No!
===	===
LEIA	Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?
LUKE	What?  Oh... the uniform.  I'm Luke Skywalker.  I'm here to rescue you.
LEIA	You're who?
LUKE	I'm here to rescue you.  I've got your R2 unit.  I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
LEIA	Ben Kenobi is here!  Where is he?
LUKE	Come on!
===	===
HAN	Chewie! Get behind me!  Get behind me! Can't get out that way.
LEIA	Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.
HAN	Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness.
LUKE	See-Threepio!  See-Threepio!
C-3PO	Yes sir?
LUKE	We've been cut off!  Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?... What was that?  I didn't copy!
===	===
LUKE	There isn't any other way out.
HAN	I can't hold them off forever! Now what?
LEIA	This is some rescue.  When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?
HAN	He's the brains, sweetheart.
LUKE	Well, I didn't...
HAN	What the hell are you doing?
LEIA	Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise guy.
HAN	Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell!  Get in there and don't worry about it. Wonderful girl!  Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.  Get in there!
===	===
HAN	Oh!  The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea.  What an incredible smell you've discovered!  Let's get out of here!  Get away from there...
LUKE	No!  wait! Will you forget it?  I already tried it.  It's magnetically sealed!
LEIA	Put that thing away!  You're going to get us all killed.
HAN	Absolutely, Your Worship.  Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here.  You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.
LEIA	It could be worse...
HAN	It's worse.
LUKE	There's something alive in here!
HAN	That's your imagination.
LUKE	Something just moves past my leg! Look!  Did you see that?
HAN	What?
LUKE	Help!
HAN	Luke!  Luke!  Luke!
LEIA	Luke! Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.
LUKE	Blast it, will you!  My gun's jammed.
HAN	Where?
LUKE	Anywhere!  Oh!!
HAN	Luke!  Luke!
LEIA	Grab him! What happened?
LUKE	I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared...
HAN	I've got a very bad feeling about this.
LUKE	The walls are moving!
LEIA	Don't just stand there.  Try and brace it with something.
LUKE	Wait a minute! Threepio!  Come in Threepio! Threepio!  Where could he be?
===	===
LUKE	Threepio!  Come in, Threepio! Threepio!
HAN	Get to the top!
LEIA	I can't
LUKE	Where could he be?  Threepio! Threepio, will you come in?
===	===
HAN	One thing's for sure.  We're all going to be a lot thinner! Get on top of it!
LEIA	I'm trying!
===	===
HAN	If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here.
LUKE	Well, let's get moving!
HAN	Where are you going?
LEIA	No, wait.  They'll hear!
HAN	Come here, you big coward! Chewie!  Come here!
LEIA	Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you.  Okay?
HAN	Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight!  I take orders from one person!  Me!
LEIA	It's a wonder you're still alive. Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?
HAN	No reward is worth this.
===	===
HAN	There she is.
LUKE	See-Threepio, do you copy?
C-3PO	For the moment.  Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship.
LUKE	We're right above you.  Stand by.
LEIA	You came in that thing?  You're braver that I thought.
HAN	Nice!  Come on!
FIRST TROOPER	It's them!  Blast them!
HAN	Get back to the ship!
LUKE	Where are you going?  Come back!
LEIA	He certainly has courage.
LUKE	What good will it do us if he gets himself killed?  Come on!
===	===
LUKE	I think we took a wrong turn.
LEIA	There's no lock!
LUKE	That oughta hold it for a while.
LEIA	Quick, we've got to get across. Find the control that extends the bridge.
LUKE	Oh, I think I just blasted it.
LEIA	They're coming through!
LUKE	Here, hold this.
LEIA	Here they come! For luck!
===	===
HAN	Didn't we just leave this party? What kept you?
LEIA	We ran into some old friends.
LUKE	Is the ship all right?
HAN	Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission.
===	===
HAN	Now's our chance!  Go!
LUKE	No!
HAN	Come on!
LEIA	Come on!  Luke, its too late!
HAN	Blast the door!  Kid!
OBI-WAN	Run, Luke!  Run!
===	===
LUKE	I can't believe he's gone.
LEIA	There wasn't anything you could have done.
HAN	Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet!
===	===
LEIA	Here they come!
===	===
LEIA	We've lost lateral controls.
HAN	Don't worry, she'll hold together. You hear me, baby?  Hold together!
===	===
LEIA	There are still two more of them out there!
===	===
LUKE	That's it!  We did it!
LEIA	We did it!
===	===
HAN	Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I even amaze myself.
LEIA	That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, they let us go.  It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.
HAN	Easy... you call that easy?
LEIA	Their tracking us!
HAN	Not this ship, sister.
LEIA	At least the information in Artoo is still intact.
HAN	What's so important?  What's he carrying?
LEIA	The technical readouts of that battle station.  I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found.  It's not over yet!
HAN	It is for me, sister!  Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess.  I expect to be well paid.  I'm in it for the money!
LEIA	You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive! Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anyone.
LUKE	I care! So... what do you think of her, Han?
HAN	I'm trying not to, kid!
LUKE	Good...
HAN	Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me...
LUKE	No!
===	===
WILLARD	You're safe!  We had feared the worst. When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... lost along with your father.
LEIA	We don't have time for our sorrows, commander.  The battle station has surely tracked us here. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.  You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack.  It is our only hope.
===	===
LEIA	What's wrong?
LUKE	Oh, it's Han!  I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind.
LEIA	He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him.
LUKE	I only wish Ben were here.
BIGGS	Luke!  I don't believe it!  How'd you get here... are you going out with us?!
LUKE	Biggs!  Of course, I'll be up there with you!  Listen, have I got some stories to tell...
RED LEADER	Are you... Luke Skywalker?  Have you been checked out on the Incom T-sixty-five?
BIGGS	Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories.
RED LEADER	I met your father once when I was just a boy.  He was a great pilot. You'll do all right.  If you've got half of your father's skill, you'll do better than all right.
LUKE	Thank you, sir.  I'll try.
BIGGS	I've got to get aboard.  Listen, you'll tell me your stories when we come back.  All right?
LUKE	I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.
BIGGS	You did, all right.  It's going to be like old times Luke. We're a couple of shooting stars that'll never be stopped!
CHIEF	This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up.  Do you want a new one?
LUKE	Not on your life!  That little droid and I have been through a lot together. You okay, Artoo?
CHIEF	Okay, easy she goes!
C-3PO	Hang on tight, Artoo, you've got to come back. You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?
OBI-WAN	Luke, the Force will be with you.
===	===
LEIA	Luke!  Luke!  Luke!
HAN	Hey!  Hey!
LUKE	I knew you'd come back!  I just knew it!
HAN	Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the reward.
LEIA	Hey, I knew there was more to you than money.
LUKE	Oh, no!
C-3PO	Oh, my!  Artoo!  Can you hear me? Say something! You can repair him, can't you?
TECHNICIAN	We'll get to work on him right away.
C-3PO	You must repair him!  Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them.
LUKE	He'll be all right.
===	===
BOUSHH	Just relax for a moment. You're free of the carbonite. Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
HAN	I can't see.
BOUSHH	You eyesight will return in time.
HAN	Where am I?
BOUSHH	Jabba's palace.
HAN	Who are you?
LEIA	Someone who loves you.
HAN	Leia!
LEIA	I gotta get you out of here.
HAN	What's that? I know that laugh. Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault.
JABBA	It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but now you're Bantha fodder.
HAN	Look...
JABBA	Take him away!
HAN	Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be a fool!
JABBA	Bring her to me.
LEIA	We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this...
JABBA	I'm sure.
LEIA	Ugh!
C-3PO	Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
===	===
LUKE	Han!
HAN	Luke!
LUKE	Are you all right?
HAN	Fine. Together again, huh?
LUKE	Wouldn't miss it.
HAN	How are we doing?
LUKE	The same as always.
HAN	That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
LEIA	I'm here.
C-3PO	Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
HAN	Good, I hate long waits.
C-3PO	You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.
HAN	Doesn't sound so bad.
C-3PO	In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
HAN	On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
LUKE	You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever make.
===	===
LEIA	Come on. We gotta get out of here quick.
C-3PO	Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!
===	===
HAN	I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
LEIA	That's all any of us can see.
HAN	Then I guess I'm getting better. I've got to hand it to you, kid, you were pretty good out there.
LUKE	I had a lot of help. Think nothing of it.
HAN	No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest thing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide awake nothing!
LUKE	I'll see you back at the fleet.
HAN	Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
LUKE	I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
HAN	(looking dubiously at Lando, obviously remembering his friend's betrayal and subsequent aide) Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
LANDO	Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
LEIA	"He means ""You're welcome."""
LANDO	Come on, let's get off this miserable dust ball.
===	===
LUKE	I'll meet you back at the fleet.
LEIA	Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now.
LUKE	I will.
HAN	Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one.
LUKE	That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend.
===	===
HAN	Well, look at you, a general, huh?
LANDO	Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
HAN	Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack.
LANDO	I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.
HAN	Well, who says they didn't.  But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember?
MON MOTHMA	The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come. The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star. Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.
ACKBAR	You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor. General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack
HAN	Good luck. You're gonna need it.
ACKBAR	General Madine.
GENERAL MADINE	We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator.
C-3PO	Sounds dangerous.
LEIA	I wonder who they found to pull that off.
GENERAL MADINE	General Solo, is your strike team assembled?
HAN	Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle. Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you. That's one.
LEIA	Uh, General... count me in.
VOICE	I'm with you, too!
LEIA	What is it?
LUKE	Ask me again sometime.
HAN	Luke.
LUKE	Hi, Han... Chewie.
C-3PO	Exciting is hardly the word I would use.
===	===
HAN	You got her warmed?
LUKE	Yeah, she's comin' up.
HAN	No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
LEIA	Hey, are you awake?
HAN	Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
LEIA	Come on, General, let's move.
HAN	Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
LUKE	All set.
C-3PO	Here we go again.
HAN	All right, hang on.
===	===
HAN	If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
CONTROLLER	We have you on our screen now. Please identify.
HAN	Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.
CONTROLLER	Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage.
HAN	Transmission commencing.
LEIA	Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
HAN	It'll work. It'll work.
LUKE	Vader's on that ship.
HAN	Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance. I don't know.  Fly casual.
LUKE	I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
HAN	It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.
===	===
C-3PO	Oh, I told you it was dangerous here.
LEIA	Shall we try and go around?
HAN	It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
===	===
HAN	Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
LUKE	Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
HAN	Hey... it's me.
SCOUT	Go for help! Go!
LUKE	Great. Come on.
LEIA	Over there! Two more of them!
LUKE	I see them. Wait, Leia! Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch!
HAN	Hey, wait! Ahhh!
===	===
LEIA	Cut it out! I'm not gonna hurt you. Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here is. Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down. I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here. All right. You want something to eat? That's right. Come on. Hmmm? Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery little thing, aren't you? What is it?
SCOUT	Freeze!  Come on, get up! Go get your ride and take her back to base. Yes, sir.
LEIA	Come on, let's get outta here.
===	===
HAN	I have a really bad feeling about this. What did he say?
C-3PO	I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
HAN	Leia!
LEIA	Oh!
C-3PO	Your Royal Highness.
LEIA	But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free.
HAN	Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
LUKE	Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
C-3PO	But Master Luke, what magic? couldn't possibly --
LUKE	Just tell them.
C-3PO	You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just... ... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh! Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh! Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness.
LUKE	Thanks, Threepio.
C-3PO	I...I never knew I had it in me.
===	===
C-3PO	Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that.
HAN	What's going on?
LEIA	I don't know.
C-3PO	Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.
HAN	Just what I always wanted. Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie. (to Wicket) Thank you. Okay.
C-3PO	He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator.
HAN	Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back. And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day.
===	===
LUKE	Luke, what's wrong? Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
LEIA	Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
LUKE	What do you remember?
LEIA	Just...images, really. Feelings.
LUKE	Tell me.
LEIA	(a little surprised at his insistence) She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. (looks up) Why are you asking me all this?
LUKE	I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
LEIA	Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
LUKE	Vader is here...now, on this moon.
LEIA	How do you know?
LUKE	I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. (facing her) As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here. (beat) I have to face him.
LEIA	Why?
LUKE	He's my father.
LEIA	Your father?
LUKE	There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.
LEIA	Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
LUKE	You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it. Yes. It's you Leia.
LEIA	I know. Somehow...I've always known.
LUKE	Then you know why I have to face him.
LEIA	No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
LUKE	No, you don't. You've always been strong.
LEIA	But, why must you confront him?
LUKE	Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.
HAN	Hey, what's goin' on?
LEIA	Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.
HAN	Nothing?  Come on, tell me.  What's goin' on?
LEIA	I...I can't tell you.
HAN	Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?
LEIA	I...
HAN	Ahhh... I'm sorry.
LEIA	Hold me.
===	===
LEIA	The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
HAN	Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
LEIA	What's he saying?
C-3PO	He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
===	===
HAN	Back door, huh? Good idea. It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble.
LEIA	Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm.
HAN	Then we'll do it real quiet-like.
C-3PO	Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
LEIA	Quiet.
C-3PO	I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
LEIA	Oh, no.
===	===
HAN	All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie.
LEIA	Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
HAN	Charges!  Come on, come on!
C-3PO	Oh, my! They'll be captured! Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me.
COMMANDER	Freeze! You Rebel scum.
===	===
STORMTROOPER	All right, move it! I said move it! Go on!
C-3PO	Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me?
BUNKER COMMANDER	Bring those two down here!
STORMTROOPER	Let's go!
C-3PO	Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea?
STORMTROOPER	Freeze! Don't move!
C-3PO	We surrender. Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo.
LEIA	The code's changed. We need Artoo!
HAN	Here's the terminal.
LEIA	Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away.
C-3PO	Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!
===	===
C-3PO	We're coming!
HAN	Come on! Come on!
C-3PO	Oh, Artoo, hurry! My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
HAN	Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
LEIA	I'll cover you.
===	===
HAN	I think I got it. I got it!
C-3PO	Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
HAN	Let's see.
LEIA	It's not bad.
STORMTROOPER	Freeze!
C-3PO	Oh, dear.
STORMTROOPER	Don't move!
HAN	I love you.
LEIA	I know.
STORMTROOPER	Hands up! Stand up!
HAN	Stay back. Chewie!  Get down here!  She's wounded!  No, wait....  I got an idea.
===	===
RIEEKAN	Solo?
HAN	No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place. You'll know if anything comes around.
RIEEKAN	Commander Skywalker reported in yet?
HAN	No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.
RIEEKAN	With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
HAN	General, I've got to leave. I can't stay anymore.
RIEEKAN	I'm sorry to hear that.
HAN	Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut, I'm a dead man.
RIEEKAN	A death mark's not an easy thing to live with. You're a good fighter, Solo. I hate to lose you.
HAN	Thank you, General. Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it.
LEIA	That's right.
HAN	Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess.
===	===
LEIA	Han!
HAN	Yes, Your Highnessness?
LEIA	I thought you decided to stay.
HAN	Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
LEIA	Han, we need you!
HAN	We?
LEIA	Yes.
HAN	Oh, what about you need?
LEIA	I need? I don't know what you're talking about.
HAN	You probably don't.
LEIA	And what precisely am I supposed to know?
HAN	Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
LEIA	Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader...
HAN	No! That's not it. Come on. Aahhh -- uh huh! Come on.
LEIA	You're imagining things.
HAN	Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?
LEIA	I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.
HAN	I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!
===	===
C-3PO	Master Luke, sir, it's good to see you fully functional again. Artoo expresses his relief, also.
HAN	How are you feeling, kid? You don't look so bad to me. In fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark.
LUKE	Thanks to you.
HAN	That's two you owe me, junior. Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer.
LEIA	I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield.
HAN	That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.
LEIA	I don't know where you get you delusions, laser brain.
HAN	Laugh it up, fuzz ball. But you didn't see us alone in the south passage. She expressed her true feelings for me.
LEIA	My...! Why, you stuck up,...half-witted,...scruffy-looking... nerf-herder!
HAN	Who's scruffy-looking?  I must have hit her pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?
LEIA	Why, I guess you don't know everything about women yet?
ANNOUNCER	Headquarters personnel, report to command center.
HAN	Take it easy.
C-3PO	Excuse us, please.
===	===
RIEEKAN	Princess...we have a visitor. We've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve, moving east.
SENIOR CONTROLLER	It's metal.
LEIA	Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke.
HAN	It could be a speeder, one of ours.
SENIOR CONTROLLER	No. Wait -- there's something very weak coming through.
C-3PO	Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code.
HAN	It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let's check it out.
RIEEKAN	Send Rouges Ten and Eleven to station three-eight.
===	===
HAN	Afraid there's not much left.
LEIA	What was it?
HAN	Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct.
LEIA	An Imperial probe droid.
HAN	It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here.
RIEEKAN	We'd better start the evacuation.
===	===
LEIA	All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance. The heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded. Only two fighter escorts per ship. The energy shield can only be opened for a short time, so you'll have to stay very close to your transports.
HOBBIE	Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?
LEIA	The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path. When you've gotten past the energy shield, proceed directly to the rendezvous point. Understood?
PILOTS	Right. Okay.
LEIA	Good luck.
DERLIN	Okay. Everyone to your stations. Let's go!
===	===
RIEEKAN	I don't think we can protect two transports at a time.
LEIA	It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no choice.
RIEEKAN	Launch patrols.
LEIA	Evacuate remaining ground staff.
===	===
HAN	You all right?
LEIA	Why are you still here?
HAN	I heard the command center had been hit.
LEIA	You got your clearance to leave.
HAN	Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm going to get you to your ship.
C-3PO	Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our only hope.
LEIA	Send all troops in sector twelve to the south slope to protect the fighters.
ANNOUNCER	Imperial troops have entered the base.
HAN	Come on...that's it.
LEIA	Give the evacuation code signal. And get to your transports!
HEAD CONTROLLER	K-one-zero...all troops disengage.
C-3PO	Oh! Wait for me!
===	===
HAN	How's this?
LEIA	Would it helped if I got out and pushed?
HAN	It might.
C-3PO	Captain Solo, Captain Solo...sir, might I suggest that you... It can wait.
===	===
LEIA	The bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
HAN	This baby's got a few surprises left in her, sweetheart.
===	===
HAN	Come on! Come on! Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a burnout. See?
LEIA	Someday you're going to be wrong, and I hope I'm there to see it.
HAN	Punch it!
===	===
HAN	I saw them! I saw them!
LEIA	Saw what?
HAN	Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us.
C-3PO	Sir, sir! Might I suggest...
HAN	Shut him up or shut him down!  Check the deflector shield! Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them.
===	===
HAN	Prepare to make the jump to light-speed.
C-3PO	But, sir!
LEIA	They're getting closer!
HAN	Oh yeah? Watch this.
LEIA	Watch what?
HAN	I think we're in trouble.
C-3PO	If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed!
HAN	We're in trouble!
===	===
HAN	Horizontal boosters...! Alluvial dampers...! Well that's not it. Bring me the hydrospanners! I don't know how we're going to get out of this one. Oww! Chewie! That was no laser blast! Something hit us.
LEIA	Han, get up here!
HAN	Come on, Chewie!
===	===
LEIA	Asteroids!
HAN	Oh, no! Chewie, set two-seven-one.
LEIA	What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid field?
HAN	They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?
LEIA	You don't have to do this to impress me.
C-3PO	Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one.
HAN	Never tell me the odds!
===	===
HAN	You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be it, sweetheart.
LEIA	I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
HAN	I'm not going to argue with that.
C-3PO	Pulverized?
HAN	I'm going in closer to one of the big ones.
LEIA	Closer?
C-3PO	Closer?!
===	===
C-3PO	Oh, this is suicide!
HAN	There. That looks pretty good.
LEIA	What looks pretty good?
HAN	Yeah. That'll do nicely.
C-3PO	Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going?
===	===
LEIA	I hope you know what you're doing.
HAN	Yeah, me too.
===	===
HAN	I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.
C-3PO	Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but...does that include shutting me down, too?
HAN	No, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.
C-3PO	Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable.
HAN	Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these things.  Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive.
C-3PO	Oh! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most...
LEIA	Let go.
HAN	Sshh!
LEIA	Let go, please.
HAN	Don't get excited.
LEIA	Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited.
HAN	Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else.
===	===
C-3PO	Oh, where is Artoo when I need him? Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.
HAN	Well, of course I'll have to replace it. Here! And Chewie... ...I think we'd better replace the negative power coupling. Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help.
LEIA	Would you please stop calling me that?
HAN	Sure, Leia.
LEIA	Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes.
HAN	I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though. (he watches her reaction) Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right.
LEIA	Occasionally  maybe...when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
HAN	Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that.
LEIA	Stop that.
HAN	Stop what?
LEIA	Stop that! My hands are dirty.
HAN	My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of?
LEIA	Afraid?
HAN	You're trembling.
LEIA	I'm not trembling.
HAN	You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life.
LEIA	I happen to like nice men.
HAN	I'm a nice man.
LEIA	No, you're not. You're...
C-3PO	Sir, sir! I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling.
HAN	Thank you. Thank you very much.
C-3PO	Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.
===	===
C-3PO	Sir, if I may venture an opinion...
HAN	I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio.
LEIA	There's something out there.
HAN	Where?
LEIA	Outside, in the cave.
C-3PO	There it is. Listen! Listen!
HAN	I'm going out there.
LEIA	Are you crazy?!
HAN	I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let something tear it apart.
LEIA	Then I'm going with you.
C-3PO	I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. (hears another mysterious noise) Oh, no.
===	===
LEIA	This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock at all.
HAN	There's an awful lot of moisture in here.
LEIA	I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this.
HAN	Yeah. Watch out! Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables.
LEIA	Mynocks?
HAN	Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more.
C-3PO	Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly thing. Shoo! Shoo!
HAN	Wait a minute...
===	===
HAN	All right, Chewie, let's get out of here!
LEIA	The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to...
HAN	No time to discuss this as a committee.
LEIA	I am not a committee!
===	===
LEIA	You can't make the jump to light-speed in this asteroid field...
HAN	Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off!
C-3PO	Look!
HAN	I see it, I see it.
C-3PO	We're doomed!
LEIA	The cave is collapsing.
HAN	This is no cave.
LEIA	What?
===	===
HAN	Let's get out of here. Ready for light-speed? One...two...three! It's not fair! The transfer circuits are working. It's not my fault!
LEIA	No light-speed?
HAN	It's not my fault.
C-3PO	Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
HAN	Turn her around. I said turn her around! I'm going to put all power in the front shield.
LEIA	You're going to attack them?!
C-3PO	Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial Star Destroyer...
LEIA	Shut up!
===	===
C-3PO	Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. (Chewie growls) No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me?
HAN	The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw.
C-3PO	I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough...
HAN	Thank you.
LEIA	What did you have in mind for your next move?
HAN	Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away.
LEIA	With the rest of the garbage. Then what?
HAN	Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any ideas?
LEIA	No. Where are we?
HAN	The Anoat system.
LEIA	Anoat system. There's not much there.
HAN	No. Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando.
LEIA	Lando system?
HAN	Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian. He's a card player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him.
LEIA	Thanks.
HAN	Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it.
LEIA	A mining colony?
HAN	Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me.
LEIA	Can you trust him?
HAN	No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that. Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach!
LEIA	You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them.
===	===
HAN	No, I don't have a landing permit. I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian. Whoa! Wait a minute! Let me explain.
INTERCOM VOICE	You will not deviate from your present course.
C-3PO	Rather touchy, aren't they?
LEIA	I thought you knew this person.
HAN	Well, that was a long time ago. I'm sure he's forgotten about that.
INTERCOM VOICE	Permission granted to land on Platform Three-two-seven.
HAN	Thank you. There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me.
LEIA	Who's worried?
===	===
C-3PO	Oh. No one to meet us.
LEIA	I don't like this.
HAN	Well, what would you like?
C-3PO	Well, they did let us land.
HAN	Look, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Trust me.
===	===
C-3PO	Well, he seems very friendly.
LEIA	Yes...very friendly.
===	===
LANDO	What are you doing here?
HAN	Ahh...repairs. I thought you could help me out.
LANDO	What have you done to my ship?
HAN	Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square.
LANDO	Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm the administrator of this facility. and who might you be?
LEIA	Leia.
LANDO	Welcome, Leia.
HAN	All right, all right, you old smoothie.
C-3PO	Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My facilities are at your... Well, really!
LANDO	What's wrong with the Falcon?
HAN	Hyperdrive.
LANDO	I'll get my people to work on it.
HAN	Good.
LANDO	You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times. She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.
===	===
HAN	The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're in great shape.
LEIA	The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost.
HAN	Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out.
LEIA	I don't trust Lando.
HAN	Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides, we'll soon be gone.
LEIA	And then you're as good as gone, aren't you?
===	===
LEIA	What happened?
HAN	Where? Found him in a junk pile?
LEIA	Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
HAN	Lando's got people who can fix him.
LEIA	No, thanks.
LANDO	I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything?
LEIA	Not really.
LANDO	You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds.
LEIA	Thank you.
LANDO	Will you join me for a little refreshment? Everyone's invited, of course. Having trouble with you droid?
HAN	No. No problem. Why?
===	===
LANDO	So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into the...uh...jurisdiction of the Empire.
LEIA	So you're part of the mining guild then?
LANDO	No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be noticed...which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves.
HAN	Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down?
LANDO	That's always been a danger looming like a shadow over everything we've built here. But things have developed that will insure security. I've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever.
===	===
C-3PO	Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not right because now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough...
HAN	I feel terrible.
LEIA	Why are they doing this?
HAN	They never even asked me any questions.
LEIA	Lando.
HAN	Get out of here, Lando!
LANDO	Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.
HAN	Over to you?
LANDO	They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
LEIA	What about Han?
LANDO	Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter.
LEIA	Vader wants us all dead.
LANDO	He doesn't want you at all. He's after somebody called Skywalker.
HAN	Luke?
LANDO	Lord Vader has set a trap for him.
LEIA	And we're the bait.
LANDO	Well, he's on his way.
HAN	Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you? My friend!
LANDO	Stop! I've done all I can do. I'm sorry I couldn't do better, but I have my own problems.
HAN	Yeah, you're a real hero.
LEIA	You certainly have a way with people.
===	===
C-3PO	If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish.
HAN	What's going on...buddy?
LANDO	You're being put into carbon freeze.
BOBA FETT	What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me.
VADER	The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in!
C-3PO	Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...!
HAN	Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop!
C-3PO	Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die.
HAN	Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey! Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess -- you have to take care of her. You hear me?
LEIA	I love you!
HAN	I know.
C-3PO	What...what's going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see. Oh...they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected -- if he survives the freezing process, that is.
VADER	Well, Calrissian, did he survive?
LANDO	Yes, he's alive. And in perfect hibernation.
VADER	He's all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker.
IMPERIAL OFFICER	Skywalker has just landed, my lord.
VADER	Good. See to it that he finds his way here. Calrissian, take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship.
LANDO	You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision.
VADER	I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.
===	===
LEIA	Luke! Luke, don't -- it's a trap! It's a trap!
===	===
LANDO	Well done. Hold them in the security tower -- and keep it quiet. Move.
LEIA	What do you think you're doing?
LANDO	We're getting out of here.
C-3PO	I knew all along it had to be a mistake.
LEIA	Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust you?
LANDO	I had no choice...
C-3PO	What are you doing? Trust him, trust him!
LEIA	Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice.
LANDO	I'm just trying to help...
LEIA	We don't need any of your help.
LANDO	H-a-a-a...
LEIA	What?
C-3PO	It sounds like Han.
LANDO	There's still a chance to save Han...I mean, at the East Platform...
LEIA	Chewie.
C-3PO	I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all, he's only a Wookiee.
===	===
LEIA	Luke...We've got to go back.
LANDO	What?
