ANAKIN	Don't play games with me, Your Highness.  You weren't on any mercy mission this time.  You passed directly through a restricted system.  Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
LEIA	I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...
===	===
LUKE	Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good.  Were you on a starcruiser or...
LEIA	Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.
C-3PO	What is what?!?  He asked you a question... What is that?
LEIA	Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.
C-3PO	I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
LEIA	Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...
===	===
OBI-WAN	I seem to have found it.
LEIA	General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.  Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.  I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.  I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit.  My father will know how to retrieve it.  You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.  This is our most desperate hour.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.
===	===
MOTTI	We've entered the Alderaan system.
LEIA	Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash.  I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.
TARKIN	Charming to the last.  You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!
LEIA	IÃ•m surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself!
TARKIN	Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational.  No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.
LEIA	The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
TARKIN	Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.  In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan.
LEIA	No!  Alderaan is peaceful.  We have no weapons.  You can't possibly...
TARKIN	You would prefer another target? A military target?  Then name the system! I grow tired of asking this.  So it'll be the last time.  Where is the Rebel base?
LEIA	Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.
TARKIN	There.  You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation.  You may fire when ready.
LEIA	What?
TARKIN	You're far too trusting.  Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration.  But don't worry. We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough.
LEIA	No!
===	===
LUKE	What?  Oh... the uniform.  I'm Luke Skywalker.  I'm here to rescue you.
LEIA	You're who?
LUKE	I'm here to rescue you.  I've got your R2 unit.  I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
LEIA	Ben Kenobi is here!  Where is he?
===	===
HAN	Chewie! Get behind me!  Get behind me! Can't get out that way.
LEIA	Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.
===	===
HAN	I can't hold them off forever! Now what?
LEIA	This is some rescue.  When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?
HAN	What the hell are you doing?
LEIA	Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise guy.
===	===
LUKE	No!  wait! Will you forget it?  I already tried it.  It's magnetically sealed!
LEIA	Put that thing away!  You're going to get us all killed.
HAN	Absolutely, Your Worship.  Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here.  You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.
LEIA	It could be worse...
HAN	Luke!  Luke!  Luke!
LEIA	Luke! Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.
HAN	Luke!  Luke!
LEIA	Grab him! What happened?
LUKE	The walls are moving!
LEIA	Don't just stand there.  Try and brace it with something.
===	===
HAN	Get to the top!
LEIA	I can't
===	===
HAN	One thing's for sure.  We're all going to be a lot thinner! Get on top of it!
LEIA	I'm trying!
===	===
HAN	Where are you going?
LEIA	No, wait.  They'll hear!
HAN	Come here, you big coward! Chewie!  Come here!
LEIA	Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you.  Okay?
HAN	Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight!  I take orders from one person!  Me!
LEIA	It's a wonder you're still alive. Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?
===	===
LUKE	We're right above you.  Stand by.
LEIA	You came in that thing?  You're braver that I thought.
LUKE	Where are you going?  Come back!
LEIA	He certainly has courage.
===	===
LUKE	I think we took a wrong turn.
LEIA	There's no lock!
LUKE	That oughta hold it for a while.
LEIA	Quick, we've got to get across. Find the control that extends the bridge.
LUKE	Oh, I think I just blasted it.
LEIA	They're coming through!
LUKE	Here, hold this.
LEIA	Here they come! For luck!
===	===
HAN	Didn't we just leave this party? What kept you?
LEIA	We ran into some old friends.
===	===
HAN	Come on!
LEIA	Come on!  Luke, its too late!
===	===
LUKE	I can't believe he's gone.
LEIA	There wasn't anything you could have done.
===	===
LUKE	That's it!  We did it!
LEIA	We did it!
===	===
HAN	Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I even amaze myself.
LEIA	That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, they let us go.  It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.
HAN	Easy... you call that easy?
LEIA	Their tracking us!
HAN	Not this ship, sister.
LEIA	At least the information in Artoo is still intact.
HAN	What's so important?  What's he carrying?
LEIA	The technical readouts of that battle station.  I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found.  It's not over yet!
HAN	It is for me, sister!  Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess.  I expect to be well paid.  I'm in it for the money!
LEIA	You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive! Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anyone.
===	===
WILLARD	You're safe!  We had feared the worst. When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... lost along with your father.
LEIA	We don't have time for our sorrows, commander.  The battle station has surely tracked us here. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.  You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack.  It is our only hope.
===	===
LUKE	Oh, it's Han!  I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind.
LEIA	He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him.
===	===
HAN	Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the reward.
LEIA	Hey, I knew there was more to you than money.
===	===
HAN	Who are you?
LEIA	Someone who loves you.
HAN	Leia!
LEIA	I gotta get you out of here.
JABBA	Bring her to me.
LEIA	We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this...
JABBA	I'm sure.
LEIA	Ugh!
===	===
HAN	That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
LEIA	I'm here.
===	===
HAN	I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
LEIA	That's all any of us can see.
LANDO	Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
LEIA	"He means ""You're welcome."""
===	===
LUKE	I'll meet you back at the fleet.
LEIA	Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now.
===	===
C-3PO	Sounds dangerous.
LEIA	I wonder who they found to pull that off.
HAN	Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle. Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you. That's one.
LEIA	Uh, General... count me in.
VOICE	I'm with you, too!
LEIA	What is it?
===	===
HAN	No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
LEIA	Hey, are you awake?
HAN	Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
LEIA	Come on, General, let's move.
===	===
HAN	Transmission commencing.
LEIA	Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
===	===
C-3PO	Oh, I told you it was dangerous here.
LEIA	Shall we try and go around?
===	===
LUKE	Great. Come on.
LEIA	Over there! Two more of them!
===	===
SCOUT	Freeze!  Come on, get up! Go get your ride and take her back to base. Yes, sir.
LEIA	Come on, let's get outta here.
===	===
HAN	Leia!
LEIA	Oh!
C-3PO	Your Royal Highness.
LEIA	But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free.
===	===
HAN	What's going on?
LEIA	I don't know.
===	===
LUKE	Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
LEIA	Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
LUKE	What do you remember?
LEIA	Just...images, really. Feelings.
LUKE	Tell me.
LEIA	(a little surprised at his insistence) She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. (looks up) Why are you asking me all this?
LUKE	I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
LEIA	Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
LUKE	Vader is here...now, on this moon.
LEIA	How do you know?
LUKE	I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. (facing her) As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here. (beat) I have to face him.
LEIA	Why?
LUKE	He's my father.
LEIA	Your father?
LUKE	There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.
LEIA	Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
LUKE	You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it. Yes. It's you Leia.
LEIA	I know. Somehow...I've always known.
LUKE	Then you know why I have to face him.
LEIA	No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
LUKE	No, you don't. You've always been strong.
LEIA	But, why must you confront him?
HAN	Hey, what's goin' on?
LEIA	Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.
HAN	Nothing?  Come on, tell me.  What's goin' on?
LEIA	I...I can't tell you.
HAN	Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?
LEIA	I...
HAN	Ahhh... I'm sorry.
LEIA	Hold me.
===	===
HAN	Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
LEIA	What's he saying?
===	===
HAN	Back door, huh? Good idea. It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble.
LEIA	Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm.
C-3PO	Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
LEIA	Quiet.
C-3PO	I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
LEIA	Oh, no.
===	===
HAN	All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie.
LEIA	Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
===	===
C-3PO	We surrender. Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo.
LEIA	The code's changed. We need Artoo!
HAN	Here's the terminal.
LEIA	Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away.
===	===
HAN	Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
LEIA	I'll cover you.
===	===
HAN	Let's see.
LEIA	It's not bad.
HAN	I love you.
LEIA	I know.
===	===
HAN	Thank you, General. Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it.
LEIA	That's right.
===	===
HAN	Yes, Your Highnessness?
LEIA	I thought you decided to stay.
HAN	Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
LEIA	Han, we need you!
HAN	We?
LEIA	Yes.
HAN	Oh, what about you need?
LEIA	I need? I don't know what you're talking about.
HAN	You probably don't.
LEIA	And what precisely am I supposed to know?
HAN	Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
LEIA	Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader...
HAN	No! That's not it. Come on. Aahhh -- uh huh! Come on.
LEIA	You're imagining things.
HAN	Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?
LEIA	I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.
===	===
HAN	That's two you owe me, junior. Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer.
LEIA	I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield.
HAN	That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.
LEIA	I don't know where you get you delusions, laser brain.
HAN	Laugh it up, fuzz ball. But you didn't see us alone in the south passage. She expressed her true feelings for me.
LEIA	My...! Why, you stuck up,...half-witted,...scruffy-looking... nerf-herder!
HAN	Who's scruffy-looking?  I must have hit her pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?
LEIA	Why, I guess you don't know everything about women yet?
===	===
SENIOR CONTROLLER	It's metal.
LEIA	Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke.
===	===
HAN	Afraid there's not much left.
LEIA	What was it?
HAN	Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct.
LEIA	An Imperial probe droid.
===	===
HOBBIE	Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?
LEIA	The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path. When you've gotten past the energy shield, proceed directly to the rendezvous point. Understood?
PILOTS	Right. Okay.
LEIA	Good luck.
===	===
RIEEKAN	I don't think we can protect two transports at a time.
LEIA	It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no choice.
RIEEKAN	Launch patrols.
LEIA	Evacuate remaining ground staff.
===	===
HAN	You all right?
LEIA	Why are you still here?
HAN	I heard the command center had been hit.
LEIA	You got your clearance to leave.
C-3PO	Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our only hope.
LEIA	Send all troops in sector twelve to the south slope to protect the fighters.
HAN	Come on...that's it.
LEIA	Give the evacuation code signal. And get to your transports!
===	===
HAN	How's this?
LEIA	Would it helped if I got out and pushed?
===	===
HAN	Come on! Come on! Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a burnout. See?
LEIA	Someday you're going to be wrong, and I hope I'm there to see it.
===	===
HAN	I saw them! I saw them!
LEIA	Saw what?
===	===
C-3PO	But, sir!
LEIA	They're getting closer!
HAN	Oh yeah? Watch this.
LEIA	Watch what?
===	===
HAN	Horizontal boosters...! Alluvial dampers...! Well that's not it. Bring me the hydrospanners! I don't know how we're going to get out of this one. Oww! Chewie! That was no laser blast! Something hit us.
LEIA	Han, get up here!
===	===
HAN	Oh, no! Chewie, set two-seven-one.
LEIA	What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid field?
HAN	They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?
LEIA	You don't have to do this to impress me.
===	===
HAN	You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be it, sweetheart.
LEIA	I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
HAN	I'm going in closer to one of the big ones.
LEIA	Closer?
===	===
HAN	There. That looks pretty good.
LEIA	What looks pretty good?
===	===
C-3PO	Oh! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most...
LEIA	Let go.
HAN	Sshh!
LEIA	Let go, please.
HAN	Don't get excited.
LEIA	Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited.
===	===
HAN	Well, of course I'll have to replace it. Here! And Chewie... ...I think we'd better replace the negative power coupling. Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help.
LEIA	Would you please stop calling me that?
HAN	Sure, Leia.
LEIA	Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes.
HAN	I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though. (he watches her reaction) Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right.
LEIA	Occasionally  maybe...when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
HAN	Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that.
LEIA	Stop that.
HAN	Stop what?
LEIA	Stop that! My hands are dirty.
HAN	My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of?
LEIA	Afraid?
HAN	You're trembling.
LEIA	I'm not trembling.
HAN	You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life.
LEIA	I happen to like nice men.
HAN	I'm a nice man.
LEIA	No, you're not. You're...
===	===
HAN	I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio.
LEIA	There's something out there.
HAN	Where?
LEIA	Outside, in the cave.
HAN	I'm going out there.
LEIA	Are you crazy?!
HAN	I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let something tear it apart.
LEIA	Then I'm going with you.
===	===
HAN	There's an awful lot of moisture in here.
LEIA	I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this.
HAN	Yeah. Watch out! Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables.
LEIA	Mynocks?
===	===
HAN	All right, Chewie, let's get out of here!
LEIA	The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to...
HAN	No time to discuss this as a committee.
LEIA	I am not a committee!
===	===
C-3PO	We're doomed!
LEIA	The cave is collapsing.
HAN	This is no cave.
LEIA	What?
===	===
HAN	Let's get out of here. Ready for light-speed? One...two...three! It's not fair! The transfer circuits are working. It's not my fault!
LEIA	No light-speed?
HAN	Turn her around. I said turn her around! I'm going to put all power in the front shield.
LEIA	You're going to attack them?!
C-3PO	Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial Star Destroyer...
LEIA	Shut up!
===	===
HAN	Thank you.
LEIA	What did you have in mind for your next move?
HAN	Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away.
LEIA	With the rest of the garbage. Then what?
HAN	Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any ideas?
LEIA	No. Where are we?
HAN	The Anoat system.
LEIA	Anoat system. There's not much there.
HAN	No. Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando.
LEIA	Lando system?
HAN	Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian. He's a card player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him.
LEIA	Thanks.
HAN	Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it.
LEIA	A mining colony?
HAN	Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me.
LEIA	Can you trust him?
HAN	No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that. Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach!
LEIA	You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them.
===	===
C-3PO	Rather touchy, aren't they?
LEIA	I thought you knew this person.
HAN	Thank you. There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me.
LEIA	Who's worried?
===	===
C-3PO	Oh. No one to meet us.
LEIA	I don't like this.
===	===
C-3PO	Well, he seems very friendly.
LEIA	Yes...very friendly.
===	===
LANDO	Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm the administrator of this facility. and who might you be?
LEIA	Leia.
===	===
HAN	The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're in great shape.
LEIA	The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost.
HAN	Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out.
LEIA	I don't trust Lando.
HAN	Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides, we'll soon be gone.
LEIA	And then you're as good as gone, aren't you?
===	===
HAN	Where? Found him in a junk pile?
LEIA	Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
HAN	Lando's got people who can fix him.
LEIA	No, thanks.
LANDO	I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything?
LEIA	Not really.
LANDO	You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds.
LEIA	Thank you.
===	===
LANDO	So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into the...uh...jurisdiction of the Empire.
LEIA	So you're part of the mining guild then?
===	===
HAN	I feel terrible.
LEIA	Why are they doing this?
HAN	They never even asked me any questions.
LEIA	Lando.
LANDO	They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
LEIA	What about Han?
LANDO	Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter.
LEIA	Vader wants us all dead.
LANDO	Lord Vader has set a trap for him.
LEIA	And we're the bait.
HAN	Yeah, you're a real hero.
LEIA	You certainly have a way with people.
===	===
HAN	Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey! Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess -- you have to take care of her. You hear me?
LEIA	I love you!
===	===
LANDO	Well done. Hold them in the security tower -- and keep it quiet. Move.
LEIA	What do you think you're doing?
C-3PO	I knew all along it had to be a mistake.
LEIA	Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust you?
C-3PO	What are you doing? Trust him, trust him!
LEIA	Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice.
LANDO	I'm just trying to help...
LEIA	We don't need any of your help.
LANDO	H-a-a-a...
LEIA	What?
LANDO	There's still a chance to save Han...I mean, at the East Platform...
LEIA	Chewie.
===	===
LANDO	What?
LEIA	I know where Luke is.
LANDO	But what about those fighter?
LEIA	Chewie, just do it.
===	===
LANDO	Look, someone's up there.
LEIA	It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him. Lando, open the top hatch.
===	===
LANDO	All right, Chewie. Ready for light-speed.
LEIA	If your people fixed the hyperdrive. All the coordinates are set. It's now or never.
===	===
