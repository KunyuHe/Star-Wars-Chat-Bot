It was just Wormie on another rampage.
Shape it up you guys!...  Biggs? I didn't know you were back! When did you get in?
Just now.  I wanted to surprise you, hot shot.  I thought you'd be here... certainly didn't expect you to be out working.
The Academy didn't change you much... but you're back so soon? Hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission?
Of course I got it.  Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last week. First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service... ... I just came back to say goodbye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons.
I almost forgot.  There's a battle going on!  Right here in our system. Come and look!
That's no battle, hot shot... they're just sitting there!  Probably a freighter-tanker refueling.
But there was a lot of firing earlier... Hey, easy with those...
You ought to take it a little easy Luke.  You may be the hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous.  Keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall.
Look who's talking.  Now that you've been around those giant starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle. You've gotten soft in the city...
I've missed you kid.
Well, things haven't been the same since you left, Biggs.  It's been so...quiet.
Luke, I didn't come back just to say goodbye...  I shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust... and if I don't come back, I want somebody to know.
What are you talking about?
I made some friends at the Academy. ... when our frigate goes to one of the central systems, we're going to jump ship and join the Alliance...
Join the Rebellion?!  Are you kidding!  How?
Quiet down will ya!  You got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater!
I'm sorry.  I'm quiet. Listen how quiet I am.  You can barely hear me...
My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact.
You√ïre crazy!  You could wander around forever trying to find them.
I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them I'll do what I can on my own...  It's what we always talked about.  Luke, I'm not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service.  The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side - the side I believe in.
And I'm stuck here...
I thought you were going to the Academy next term.  You'll get your chance to get off this rock.
Not likely!  I had to cancel my application.  There has been a lot of unrest among the Sand People since you left... they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead.
Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sand People with one blaster.
I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off.  He needs me for just one more season. I can't leave him now.
I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important. What good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire?...  You know they're starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems... it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the Empire.
It couldn't happen here.  You said it yourself.  The Empire won't bother with this rock.
Things always change.
I wish I was going...  Are you going to be around long?
No, I'm leaving in the morning...
Then I guess I won't see you.
Maybe someday...  I'll keep a lookout.
Well, I'll be at the Academy next season... after that who knows.  I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that's for sure...  Take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend I've got.
Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.
It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him.
Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you?  I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner.
But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters...
You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done.  Now, come on, get to it!
All right, come on!  And the red one, come on.  Well, come on, Red, let's go. Uncle Owen...
Yeah?
This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look!
Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition.  A real bargain.
Uncle Owen...
Yeah?
What about that one?
What about that blue one?  We'll take that one.
Yeah, take it away.
Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir.  He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before.  Here he comes.
Okay, let's go.
Thank the maker!  This oil bath is going to feel so good.  I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!
It just isn't fair.  Oh, Biggs is right.  I'm never gonna get out of here!
Is there anything I might do to help?
Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!
I don't think so, sir.  I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.  Not on this planet, anyways.  As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.
Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.
I see, sir.
Uh, you can call me Luke.
I see, sir Luke.
Just Luke.
And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.
Hello. You got a lot of carbon scoring here.  It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.
With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.
You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.
Have you been in many battles?
Several, I think.  Actually, there's not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.
Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good.  Were you on a starcruiser or...
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.
What's this?
Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction.  Old data. Pay it no mind.
Who is she?  She's beautiful.
I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.  A person of some importance, sir - I believe.  Our captain was attached to...
Is there more to this recording?
Behave yourself, Artoo.  You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him.  He's our new master. He says he's the property of Obi- Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts.  And it's a private message for him.  Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what he's talking about.  Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.
Obi-Wan Kenobi?  I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?
I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?
Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea.  He's kind of a strange old hermit. I wonder who she is.  It sounds like she's in trouble.  I'd better play back the whole thing.
He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system.  He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.
H'm?  Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off!  Okay. There you go. Well, wait a minute.  Where'd she go?  Bring her back!  Play back the entire message.
Luke?  Luke!  Come to dinner!
All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.
I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.
Well, see what you can do with him.  I'll be right back.
What makes you think that?
Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him.  He says he belongs to someone called Obi- Wan Kenobi. I thought he might have meant Ben. Do you know what he's talking about?  Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben.
That old man's just a crazy wizard.  Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That'll be the end of it.  It belongs to us now.
But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?
He won't, I don't think he exists any more.  He died about the same time as your father.
He knew my father?
I told you to forget it.  Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow.  In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.
Yes, sir.  I think those new droids are going to work out fine.  In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season.  And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.
You mean the next semester before harvest?
Sure, there're more than enough droids.
Harvest is when I need you the most.  Only one more season. This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands.  And then you can go to the Academy next year. You must understand I need you here, Luke.
But it's a whole 'nother year.
Look, it's only one more season.
Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.
Where are you going?
It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those droids.
It wasn't my fault, sir.  Please don't deactivate me.  I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.
Oh, no!
That R2 unit has always been a problem.  These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand.  Even I can't understand their logic at times.
How could I be so stupid?  He's nowhere in sight.  Blast it!
Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?
It's too dangerous with all the Sand People around.  We'll have to wait until morning.
Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night.
All right, I'll be there in a few minutes.  Boy, am I gonna get it. You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.
Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault.
Sure.  He needs you.  He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...
Deactivate!  Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt...
Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner.  It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator.
Master Luke here is your rightful owner.  We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me of your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.
Well, come on. It's getting late. I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up.
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop.
No, he's not going to try anything. What's wrong with him now?
Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.
Sand People!  Or worse!  Come on, let's have a look.  Come on.
Hello there!  Come here my little friend.  Don't be afraid. Don't worry, he'll be all right.
What happened?
Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day.  You're fortunate you're still in one piece.
Ben?  Ben Kenobi!  Boy, am I glad to see you!
The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly.  Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far?
Oh, this little droid!  I think he's searching for his former master ...  I've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems to be no stopping him.  He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about?
Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan?  Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time.
I think my uncle knew him.  He said he was dead.
Oh, he's not dead, no... not yet.
You know him!
Well of course, of course I know him.  He's me!  I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.
Then the droid does belong to you.
Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid.  Very interesting... I think we better get indoors. The Sand People are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.
... Threepio!
Where am I?  I must have taken a bad step...
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before the Sand People return.
I don't think I can make it.  You go on, Master Luke.  There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that?
That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals.  Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.
You fought in the Clone Wars?
Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.
I wish I'd known him.
Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile.
Sure, go ahead. What is it?
Your fathers lightsaber.  This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster. An elegant weapon for a more civilized time.  For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.  Before the dark times, before the Empire.
How did my father die?
A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.  He betrayed and murdered your father.  Now the Jedi are all but extinct.  Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.
The Force?
Well, the Force is what gives the Jedi his power.  It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend.  And where you come from.
I saw part of the message he was...
You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.
Alderaan?  I'm not going to Alderaan.  I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.
I need your help, Luke.  I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. She needs your help.
I can't get involved!  I've got work to do!  It's not that I like the Empire.  I hate it!  But there's nothing I can do about it right now.  It's such a long way from here.
That's your uncle talking.
Oh, God, my uncle.  How am I ever going to explain this?
Learn about the Force, Luke.
Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.  You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
They didn't.  But we are meant to think they did.  These tracks are side by side.  Sand People always ride single file to hide there numbers.
These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.
And these blast points, too accurate for Sand People.  Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas? If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to.  And that would lead them back home!
There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire.
I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing here for me now.  I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.
How long have you had these droids?
About three or four seasons.
I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures.
Go on, go on.  I can't understand how we got by those troopers.  I thought we were dead.
The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.  You will find it a powerful ally.
Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?
Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here.  Only watch your step.  This place can be a little rough.
I'm ready for anything.
We don't serve their kind here!
What?
Your droids. They'll have to wait outside.  We don't want them here.
Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder.  We don't want any trouble.
He doesn't like you.
I'm sorry.
I don't like you either Don't insult us.  You just watch yourself.  We're wanted men.  I have the death sentence on twelve systems.
I'll be careful than.
Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?  And it's going to cost you something extra.  Ten thousand in advance.
Ten thousand?  We could almost buy our own ship for that!
But who's going to fly it, kid! You?
You bet I could.  I'm not such a bad pilot myself!  We don't have to sit here and listen...
You'll have to sell your speeder.
That's okay.  I'm never coming back to this planet again.
Stay sharp!  There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off.
Why don't you outrun them?  I thought you said this thing was fast.
It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi- computer.
Are you kidding?  At the rate they're gaining...
Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!  Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?
What's that flashing?
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.
You mean it controls your actions?
Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.
You don't believe in the Force, do you?
I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.
With the blast shield down, I can't even see.  How am I supposed to fight?
Look, going good against remotes is one thing.  Going good against the living?  That's something else. Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.
You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote.
Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in the sublight engines. What the...?  Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts.
What's going on?
Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!
What do you mean?  Where is it?
Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid.  It ain't there.  It's been totally blown away.
What?  How?
The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.  It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've... There's another ship coming in.
Maybe they know what happened.
It's an Imperial fighter.
It followed us!
A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.
Then he must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something...
It's too big to be a space station.
I have a very bad feeling about this.
Yeah, I think your right.  Full reverse!  Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
Why are we still moving towards it?
We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in!
But there's gotta be something you can do!
TX-four-one-two.  Why aren't you at your post?  TX-four-one-two, do you copy? Take over.  We've got a bad transmitter.  I'll see what I can do.
You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.
Whatever you say.  I've done more than I bargained for on this trip already.
I want to go with you.
Be patient, Luke.  Stay and watch over the droids.
But he can...
Boy you said it, Chewie. Where did you dig up that old fossil?
Ben is a great man.
Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.
I didn't hear you give any ideas...
Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for them to pick us up...
Who do you think... What is it?
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says "I found her," and keeps repeating, "She's here."
Well, who... who has he found?
Princess Leia.
The princess?  She's here?
Princess?
Where... where is she?
Level five. Detention block AA- twenty-three.  I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.
Oh, no!  We've got to do something.
What are you talking about?
The droid belongs to her.  She's the one in the message.  We've got to help her.
Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.  The old man wants us to wait right here.
But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?
I'm not going anywhere.
They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured.  Now all you want to do is stay.
Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.
But they're going to kill her!
Better her than me...
She's rich.
Rich?
Yes.  Rich, powerful!  Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...
What?
Well more wealth that you can imagine.
I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!
You'll get it!
I better!
You will...
All right, kid.  But you'd better be right about this!
All right.
What's your plan?
Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders there will you? Okay.  Now, I'm going to put these on you. Okay.  Han, you put these on.
Master Luke, sir!  Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?
Lock the door!
This is not going to work.
Why didn't you say so before?
Where are you taking this... thing?
Prisoner transfer from Block one- one-three-eight.
Look out!  He's loose!
He's going to pull us all apart.
Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?
What?  Oh... the uniform.  I'm Luke Skywalker.  I'm here to rescue you.
You're who?
I'm here to rescue you.  I've got your R2 unit.  I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
Ben Kenobi is here!  Where is he?
Come on!
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness.
See-Threepio!  See-Threepio!
Yes sir?
We've been cut off!  Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?... What was that?  I didn't copy!
He's the brains, sweetheart.
Well, I didn't...
Oh!  The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea.  What an incredible smell you've discovered!  Let's get out of here!  Get away from there...
No!  wait! Will you forget it?  I already tried it.  It's magnetically sealed!
It's worse.
There's something alive in here!
That's your imagination.
Something just moves past my leg! Look!  Did you see that?
What?
Help!
Luke! Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.
Blast it, will you!  My gun's jammed.
Where?
Anywhere!  Oh!!
Grab him! What happened?
I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared...
I've got a very bad feeling about this.
The walls are moving!
Don't just stand there.  Try and brace it with something.
Wait a minute! Threepio!  Come in Threepio! Threepio!  Where could he be?
I can't
Where could he be?  Threepio! Threepio, will you come in?
We've had some problems...
Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level, will you? Do you copy?
No.  Shut them all down!  Hurry! Listen to them!  They're dying, Artoo!  Curse my metal body!  I wasn't fast enough.  It's all my fault!  My poor master!
Threepio, we're all right!
If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here.
Well, let's get moving!
There she is.
See-Threepio, do you copy?
For the moment.  Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship.
We're right above you.  Stand by.
Get back to the ship!
Where are you going?  Come back!
He certainly has courage.
What good will it do us if he gets himself killed?  Come on!
There's no lock!
That oughta hold it for a while.
Quick, we've got to get across. Find the control that extends the bridge.
Oh, I think I just blasted it.
They're coming through!
Here, hold this.
We ran into some old friends.
Is the ship all right?
Now's our chance!  Go!
No!
You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive! Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anyone.
I care! So... what do you think of her, Han?
I'm trying not to, kid!
Good...
Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me...
No!
That's impossible, even for a computer.
It's not impossible.  I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home.  They're not much bigger than two meters.
All flight troops, man your stations. All flight troops, man your stations.
So... you got your reward and you're just leaving then?
That's right, yeah!  I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff.  Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you?  Why don't you come with us?  You're pretty good in a fight.  I could use you.
Come on!  Why don't you take a look around?  You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.
What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?  Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage.  It's more like suicide.
All right.  Well, take care of yourself, Han... guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?
What's wrong?
Oh, it's Han!  I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind.
He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him.
I only wish Ben were here.
Luke!  I don't believe it!  How'd you get here... are you going out with us?!
Biggs!  Of course, I'll be up there with you!  Listen, have I got some stories to tell...
I met your father once when I was just a boy.  He was a great pilot. You'll do all right.  If you've got half of your father's skill, you'll do better than all right.
Thank you, sir.  I'll try.
I've got to get aboard.  Listen, you'll tell me your stories when we come back.  All right?
I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.
This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up.  Do you want a new one?
Not on your life!  That little droid and I have been through a lot together. You okay, Artoo?
Red Eleven standing by.
Red Five standing by.
Watch yourself!  There's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower.
I'm on it.
I'm hit!  I can't stay with you.
Get clear, Wedge.
His computer's off.  Luke, you switched off your targeting computer.  What's wrong?
Nothing.  I'm all right.
Hey!  Hey!
I knew you'd come back!  I just knew it!
Hey, I knew there was more to you than money.
Oh, no!
You must repair him!  Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them.
He'll be all right.
The message, Artoo, the message.
Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. (Jabba's crowd laughs) With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids.
What did he say?
... Both are hardworking and will serve you well.
I told you not to admit him.
I must be allowed to speak.
You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick.
You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.
Your mind powers will not work on me, boy.
Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers.
Luke!
Are you all right?
Fine. Together again, huh?
Wouldn't miss it.
How are we doing?
The same as always.
On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever make.
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. Right?
Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die.
Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump.
Come on!
Then I guess I'm getting better. I've got to hand it to you, kid, you were pretty good out there.
I had a lot of help. Think nothing of it.
No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest thing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide awake nothing!
I'll see you back at the fleet.
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now.
I will.
Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one.
That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend.
Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?
No... of course not.
I do, yes, I do!  Sick have I become. Old and weak. (Points a crooked finger) When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm? Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have.
Master Yoda, you can't die.
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things ... the way of the Force.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
Then I am a Jedi?
Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.
Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?
Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.
Yoda, I must know.
Your father he is. Told you, did he?
Yes.
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you.
Well, I'm sorry.
Yoda will always be with you.
Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me? You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.
A certain point of view!
Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. I don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it certainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened to your father was my fault. Anakin was a good friend. When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him.  I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi.  I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda.  I was wrong.  My pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy.
There's still good in him.
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
I can't do it, Ben.
You cannot escape your destiny.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke...but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience.  Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
But I had to help my friends.
And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved little by rushing back prematurely, I fear.
I found out Darth Vader was my father.
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
I can't kill my own father.
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
Yoda spoke of another.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
But I have no sister.
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
Leia! Leia's my sister.
Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor. When your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your mother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible.  So I took you to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan. The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew she'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power, since Alderaan had long been a democracy.  Even so, the family continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster father's path, became a senator as well.  That's not all she became, of course... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause.  That's what she was doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became desperate.
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
What is it?
Ask me again sometime.
Luke.
Hi, Han... Chewie.
You got her warmed?
Yeah, she's comin' up.
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
All set.
It'll work. It'll work.
Vader's on that ship.
Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance. I don't know.  Fly casual.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
Go for help! Go!
Great. Come on.
Over there! Two more of them!
I see them. Wait, Leia! Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch!
Luke! Where's Leia?
What? She didn't come back?
I thought she was with you.
We got separated. Hey, we better go look for her.
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
Oh, Master Luke.
There's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.
Hey, I don't get it. Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie.
Chewie, wa-wait!  Don't!
Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. (trying to free an arm) Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
Wha--?  Hey!  Point that thing someplace else. Hey!
Han, don't. It'll be all right. Chewie, give 'em your crossbow.
Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness!
Do you understand anything they're saying?
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
But Master Luke, what magic? couldn't possibly --
Just tell them.
You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just... ... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh! Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh! Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness.
Thanks, Threepio.
Luke, what's wrong?
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
What do you remember?
Just...images, really. Feelings.
Tell me.
(a little surprised at his insistence) She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. (looks up) Why are you asking me all this?
I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
Vader is here...now, on this moon.
How do you know?
I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. (facing her) As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here. (beat) I have to face him.
Why?
He's my father.
Your father?
There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it. Yes. It's you Leia.
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
Then you know why I have to face him.
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
But, why must you confront him?
Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.
The Emperor has been expecting you.
I know, father.
So, you have accepted the truth.
I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father.
That name no longer has any meaning for me.
It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now.
I see you have constructed a new lightsaber. Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen.
Come with me.
Obi-Wan once thought as you do. You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
If that is your destiny.
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.
Then my father is truly dead.
Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you. You no longer need those. Guards, leave us. I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call me Master.
You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father.
Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with you.
You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.
Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet. Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here.
Your overconfidence is your weakness.
Come, boy. See for yourself. From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion. You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant.
No!
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
I will not fight you, father.
You are unwise to lower your defenses.
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
There is no conflict.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
I will not fight you.
Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for... Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
Never-r-r!
Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side!
Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me.
If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed. Young fool...only now, at the end, do you understand. Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You have paid the price for your lack of vision.
Father, please. Help me.
Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes. Now...go, my son. Leave me.
No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you.
You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right.
Father... I won't leave you.
Loud and clear, kid. What's up?
Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. The sensors are placed. I'm going back.
Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long. Hey, steady girl. What's the matter? You smell something? Aaargh!
Luke...Luke.
Ben?
You will go to the Dagobah system.
Dagobah system?
There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me.
Ben...Ben.
Luke! Luke! Don't do this, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here. Not much time.
Ben...Ben...
Hang on, kid.
Dagobah system...
Whew...
Dagobah...
This may smell bad, kid...
Yoda...
How are you feeling, kid? You don't look so bad to me. In fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark.
Thanks to you.
Sir, it will take quite awhile to evacuate the T-forty- sevens.
Well, forget the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports.
Take care, sir.
Thanks.
Hi, kid.  There's got to be a reason for it. Check it at the other end. Wait a second. (to Luke) You all right?
Yeah.
Be careful.
You, too.
Feeling all right, sir?
Just like new, Dack. How about you?
Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself.
I know what you mean.
Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set.
Steady, Dack. Attack pattern delta. Go now!
Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control. I'll have to cut in the auxiliary.
Just hang on. Hang on, Dack. Get ready to fire that tow cable.
Copy, Rouge Leader
Wedge, I've lost my gunner. You'll have to make this shot. I'll cover for you. Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass.
Set for position three.  Steady.
Stay tight and low.
Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous.
Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going.
Feel like what?
Like we're being watched!
Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm. I am wondering, why are you here?
I'm looking for someone.
Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm?
Right.
Help you I can. Yes, mmmm.
I don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior.
Ahhh! A great warrior.  Wars not make one great.
Put that down. Hey! That's my dinner.
How you get so big, eating food of this kind?
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just...
Aww, cannot get your ship out?
Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh...you're making a mess. Hey, give me that!
Mine! Or I will help you not.
I don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole.
Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is. Ah, ah, ah!
Oh, Artoo, let him have it.
Mine! Mine!
Artoo!
Mine!
Now will you move along, little fella? We're got a lot of work to do.
No! No, no! Stay and help you, I will.  Find your friend, hmm?
I'm not looking for a friend, I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda.
You know him?
Mmm. Take you to him, I will.  Yes, yes. But now, we must eat. Come. Good food. Come. Come, come.
Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo.
Patience! For the Jedi it is time to eat as well. Eat, eat. Hot. Good food, hm? Good, hmm?
How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there?
Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him. (tasting food from the pot) Rootleaf, I cook. Why wish you become Jedi? Hm?
Mostly because of my father, I guess.
Ah, your father. Powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi, mmm.
Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am. (fed up) Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time.
Hah. He is not ready.
Yoda! I am ready. I...Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm ready.
He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training.
But I've learned so much.
Will he finished what he begins?
I won't fail you -- I'm not afraid.
Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger...fear...aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.
Vader. Is the dark side stronger?
No...no...no. Quicker, easier, more seductive.
But how am I to know the good side from the bad?
You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.
But tell me why I can't...
No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmm.
There's something not right here. I feel cold, death.
That place...is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go.
What's in there?
Use the Force. Yes... Now...the stone. Feel it. Concentrate!
Oh, no. We'll never get it out now.
So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say?
Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally different.
No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned.
All right, I'll give it a try.
No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.
I can't. It's too big.
Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm? Mmmm. And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It's energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we...(Yoda pinches Luke's shoulder)...not this crude matter. (a sweeping gesture) You must feel the Force around you. (gesturing) Here, between you...me...the tree...the rock...everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship!
You want the impossible. I don't...I don't believe it.
Concentrate...feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm, yes. Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future...the past. Old friends long gone.
Han! Leia!
Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control.
I saw...I saw a city in the clouds.
Mmm. Friends you have there.
They were in pain.
It is the future you see.
Future? Will they die?
Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.
I've got to go to them.
Luke! You must complete the training.
I can't keep the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I've got to help them.
You must not go!
But Han and Leia will die if I don't.
You don't know that. Even Yoda cannot see their fate.
But I can help them! I feel the Force!
Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure at the cave!
But I've learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to return and finish what I've begun. You have my word.
It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. that is why your friends are made to suffer.
And that is why I have to go.
Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost Vader.
You won't.
Patience.
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot interfere.
I understand.  Artoo, fire up the converters.
Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.
I will. And I'll return. I promise.
You have learned much, young one.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be true.
No!
You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did. There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.
I'll never join you!
If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.
He told me enough! He told me you killed him.
No. I am your father.
No. No. That's not true! That's impossible!
Search your feelings. You know it to be true.
No! No! No!
Luke, we're ready for takeoff.
Good luck, Lando
