yes indeed  if it will a fast ship
should i have
only passengers  myself the boy two droids and no questions asked
let will just say we is like to avoid any imperial entanglements
ten thousand  we could almost buy our own ship for that
we havecan not that much with us but we could pay you two thousand now plus fifteen when we reach alderaan
ninetyfour
all right we have check it out
going somewhere solo
it will too late  you should have paid him when you had the chance jabba will put a price on your head so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you  ilet us lucky i found you first
if you give it to me i might forget i found you
jabba will through with you  he has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser
you can tell that to jabba  he may only take your ship
that will the idea i are been looking forward to killing you for a long time
come on out solo
i expected you would be
han my boy there are times when you disappoint me  why havecan not you paid me  and why did you have to fry poor greedo like that  after all we are been through together
han why you am the best smuggler in the business  you am too valuable to fry  he was only relaying my concern at your delays  he wascan not going to blast you
han han  if only you hadcan not had to dump that shipment of spice  you understand i just  had make an exception  where would i be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an imperial starship  it will not good business
put your blasters away  han my boy ilet us only doing this because you am the best and i need you  so for an extra say  twenty percent i have give you a little more time  but this is it  if you disappoint me again i have put a price on your head so large you will not be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life
what a piece of junk
why docan not you outrun them  i thought you said this thing was fast
how long before you can make the jump to light speed
are you kidding  at the rate they am gaining 
what will that flashing
i felt a great disturbance in the force  as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced  i fear something terrible has happened you is better get on with your exercises
now be careful artoo he made a fair move  screaming about it will not help you
but sir nobody worries about upsetting a droid
partially but it also obeys your commands
you docan not believe in the force do you
your eyes can deceive you  docan not trust them stretch out with your feelings you see you can do it
in my experience there will no such thing as luck
what will going on
what do you mean  where is it
destroyed  by the empire
no  it will a short range fighter
it sure is leaving in a big hurry if they identify us we am in big trouble
it is be as well to let it go it will too far out of range
then he must have gotten lost been part of a convoy or something 
look at him  he will heading for that small moon
that will no moon  it will a space station
turn the ship around
why are we still moving towards it
but there will gotta be something you can do
boy it will lucky you had these compartments
leave that to me
the ship will all yours  if the scanners pick up anything report it immediately  all right would not go
you know between his howling and your blasting everything in sight it will a wonder the whole station doescan not know we am here
i docan not think you boys can help i must go alone
they must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as alderaan  your destiny lies along a different path from mine  the force will be with you   always
ben is a great man
i didcan not hear you give any ideas 
the princess  she will here
where  where is she
oh no  we are got to do something
the droid belongs to her  she will the one in the message  we are got to help her
but he didcan not know she was here look will you just find a way back into the detention block
they am going to execute her look a few minutes ago you said you didcan not want to just wait here to be captured  now all you want to do is stay
but they am going to kill her
she will rich
yes  rich powerful  listen if you were to rescue her the reward would be 
well more wealth that you can imagine
you have get it
you will 
all right
uh  threepio hand me those binders there will you okay  now ilet us going to put these on you okay  han you put these on
lock the door
why didcan not you say so before
i wascan not notified  i have have to clear it
he will going to pull us all apart
what happened
we am sending a squad up
who is this  what will your operating number
looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route
there iscan not any other way out
this is some rescue  when you came in here didcan not you have a plan for getting out
well i didcan not 
somebody has to save our skins into the garbage chute wise guy
put that thing away  you am going to get us all killed
it could be worse 
there will something alive in here
something just moves past my leg look  did you see that

it will a wonder you am still alive will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way
you came in that thing  you am braver that i thought
it will them  blast them
is the ship all right
no
come on  luke its too late
there wascan not anything you could have done
we are lost lateral controls
got him  i got him
that doescan not sound too hard besides they let us go  it will the only explanation for the ease of our escape
their tracking us
at least the information in artoo is still intact
the technical readouts of that battle station  i only hope that when the data is analyzed a weakness can be found  it will not over yet
i care so  what do you think of her han
good 
so  you got your reward and you am just leaving then
come on  why docan not you take a look around  you know what will about to happen what they am up against they could use a good pilot like you you am turning your back on them
all right  well take care of yourself han  guess that will what you am best at iscan not it
luke  luke  luke
i knew you is come back  i just knew it
just relax for a moment you am free of the carbonite shhh you have hibernation sickness

jabba will palace
someone who loves you
i gotta get you out of here
it will too late for that solo you may have been a good smuggler but now you am bantha fodder
take him away
han
are you all right
wouldcan not miss it
the same as always
oh dear his high exaltedness the great jabba the hutt has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately
you will therefore be taken to the dune sea and cast into the pit of carkoon the nesting place of the allpowerful sarlacc
in his belly you will find a new definition of pain and suffering as you are slowly digested over a thousand years
there will nothing to see i used to live here you know
just stick close to chewie and lando i are taken care of everything
han chewie
lower it
hold it whoa
no wait i thought you were blind
all right a little higher just a little higher

i had a lot of help think nothing of it
i have see you back at the fleet
i have a promise i have to keep first  to an old friend
i will
oh well someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of taanab
ilet us surprised they didcan not ask you to do it
you can see here the death star orbiting the forest moon of endor although the weapon systems on this death star are not yet operational the death star does have a strong defense mechanism it is protected by an energy shield which is generated from the nearby forest moon of endor the shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted once the shield is down our cruisers will create a perimeter while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor general calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack
general solo is your strike team assembled
ask me again sometime
all right old buddy you know i know what she means to you i have take good care of her sheshe will not get a scratch all right
look would you get going you pirate good luck
yeah she will comin  up
hey are you awake
come on general would not move
here we go again
we have you on our screen now please identify
shuttle tydirium transmit the clearance code for shield passage
now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid
vader will on that ship
ilet us endangering the mission i shouldcan not have come
shuttle tydirium deactivation of the shield will commence immediately follow your present course
shall we try and go around
quietly there might be more of them out there
i see them wait leia quick jam their comlink center switch

we got separated hey we better go look for her
ilet us afraid that artoo will sensors can find no trace of princess leia
chewie wawait  docan not
will you take it easy let will just figure out a way to get out of this thing trying to free an arm han can you reach my lightsaber
artoo ilet us not sure that will such a good idea it will a very long drooop
oh yes master luke  remember that i am fluent in over six million forms of communication
hello i think  i could be mistaken they am using a very primitive dialect  but i do believe they think i am some sort of god
i beg your pardon general solo but that just wouldcan not be proper
it will against my programming to impersonate a deity
ilet us rather embarrassed general solo but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor
but these are my friends threepio tell them they must be set free
yes artoo i was just coming to that
wonderful we are now a part of the tribe
he says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator
because there is good in him i are felt it he will not turn me over to the emperor i can save him i can turn him back to the good side i have to try
nothing i  just want to be alone for a little while
i i  had tell you
i 
the main entrance to the control bunker will on the far side of that landing platform this iscan not gonna be easy
well it only takes one to sound the alarm
han hurry the fleet will be here any moment
the code will changed we need artoo

oh artoo hurry my goodness artoo why did you have to be so brave
oh princess leia are you all right
docan not move
hands up stand up
echo three to echo seven han old buddy do you read me
well i finished my circle i docan not pick up any life readings

that will right
han
i thought you decided to stay
han we need you

master luke sir it will good to see you fully functional again artoo expresses his relief also
thanks to you
i had nothing to do with it general rieekan thinks it will dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we are activated the energy shield
i docan not know where you get you delusions laser brain
my  why you stuck up halfwitted scruffylooking  nerfherder
headquarters personnel report to command center
then it couldcan not be one of those creatures that attacked luke
sir i am fluent in six million forms of communication this signal is not used by the alliance it could be an imperial code
what was it
an imperial probe droid
chewie take care of yourself okay
yeah
why are you still here
you got your clearance to leave
imperial troops have entered the base
wait wait for me wait stop how typical
would it helped if i got out and pushed
the bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade
someday you am going to be wrong and i hope ilet us there to see it
saw what
sir sir might i suggest 
they am getting closer
watch what
if i may say so sir i noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged it will impossible to go to lightspeed
han get up here
asteroids
what are you doing you am not actually going into an asteroid field
sir the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand seven hundred and twenty to one
i take it back we am going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer
pulverized
oh this is suicide
what looks pretty good
i hope you know what you am doing
sir ilet us almost afraid to ask but does that include shutting me down too
sir it will quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable
let go
let go please
captain being held by you iscan not quite enough to get me excited
oh where is artoo when i need him sir i docan not know where your ship learned to communicate but it has the most peculiar dialect i believe sir it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized ilet us afraid you have have to replace it
would you please stop calling me that
oh you make it so difficult sometimes
occasionally  maybe when you arecan not acting like a scoundrel
stop that
stop that my hands are dirty
afraid
ilet us not trembling
i happen to like nice men
sir sir i are isolated the reverse power flux coupling
sir if i may venture an opinion 
there will something out there
there it is listen listen
are you crazy
this ground sure feels strange it doescan not feel like rock at all
i docan not know i have a bad feeling about this
mynocks
ohhh go away go away beastly thing shoo shoo
the empire is still out there i docan not think it will wise to 
you  had make the jump to lightspeed in this asteroid field 
look
the cave is collapsing
no lightspeed
sir we just lost the main rear deflector shield one more direct hit on the back quarter and we am done for
captain solo this time you have gone too far chewie growls no i will not be quiet chewbacca why doescan not anyone listen to me
i really docan not see how thats going to help surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances the empire may be gracious enough 
what did you have in mind for your next move
with the rest of the garbage then what
no where are we
anoat system there will not much there
lando system

i docan not trust lando
what happened
oh what a mess chewie do you think you can repair him
will you join me for a little refreshment everyone will invited of course having trouble with you droid
