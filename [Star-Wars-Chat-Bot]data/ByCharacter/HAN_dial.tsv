OBI-WAN	Yes, indeed.  If it's a fast ship.
HAN	Fast ship?  You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?
OBI-WAN	Should I have?
HAN	It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs! I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.  I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.  She's fast enough for you, old man.  What's the cargo?
OBI-WAN	Only passengers.  Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked.
HAN	What is it?  Some kind of local trouble?
OBI-WAN	Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.
HAN	Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?  And it's going to cost you something extra.  Ten thousand in advance.
LUKE	Ten thousand?  We could almost buy our own ship for that!
HAN	But who's going to fly it, kid! You?
OBI-WAN	We haven't that much with us. But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.
HAN	Seventeen, huh! Okay.  You guys got yourself a ship.  We'll leave as soon as you're ready.  Docking bay Ninety-four.
OBI-WAN	Ninety-four.
HAN	Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.
TROOPER	All right, we'll check it out.
HAN	Seventeen thousand!  Those guys must really be desperate.  This could really save my neck.  Get back to the ship and get her ready.
===	===
GREEDO	Going somewhere, Solo?
HAN	Yes, Greedo.  As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money.
GREEDO	It's too late.  You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.  I'm lucky I found you first.
HAN	Yeah, but this time I got the money.
GREEDO	If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.
HAN	I don't have it with me.  Tell Jabba...
GREEDO	Jabba's through with you.  He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.
HAN	Even I get boarded sometimes.  Do you think I had a choice?
GREEDO	You can tell that to Jabba.  He may only take your ship.
HAN	Over my dead body.
GREEDO	That's the idea I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time.
HAN	Yes, I'll bet you have. Sorry about the mess.
===	===
JABBA	Come on out, Solo!
HAN	I've been waiting for you, Jabba.
JABBA	I expected you would be.
HAN	I'm not the type to run.
JABBA	Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me... why haven't you paid me?  And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that... after all we've been through together.
HAN	You sent Greedo to blast me.
JABBA	Han, why you're the best smuggler in the business.  You're too valuable to fry.  He was only relaying my concern at your delays.  He wasn't going to blast you.
HAN	I think he thought he was.  Next time don't send one of those twerps. If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself.
JABBA	Han, Han!  If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can't make an exception.  Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship?  It's not good business.
HAN	You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.  I had no choice, but I've got a charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra.  I just need some more time.
JABBA	Put your blasters away.  Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you.  So, for an extra, say... twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but this is it.  If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.
HAN	Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my pleasure.
===	===
LUKE	What a piece of junk.
HAN	She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.  She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.  I've added some special modifications myself. We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here.
===	===
LUKE	Why don't you outrun them?  I thought you said this thing was fast.
HAN	Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home.  We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!
===	===
OBI-WAN	How long before you can make the jump to light speed?
HAN	It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi- computer.
LUKE	Are you kidding?  At the rate they're gaining...
HAN	Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!  Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?
LUKE	What's that flashing?
HAN	We're losing our deflector shield. Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed.
===	===
OBI-WAN	I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.  I fear something terrible has happened. You'd better get on with your exercises.
HAN	Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.  I told you I'd outrun 'em. Don't everyone thank me at once. Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.
C-3PO	Now be careful, Artoo. He made a fair move.  Screaming about it won't help you.
HAN	Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
C-3PO	But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.
HAN	That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose.  Wookiees are known to do that.
OBI-WAN	Partially. But it also obeys your commands.
HAN	Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.
LUKE	You don't believe in the Force, do you?
HAN	Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.  I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
OBI-WAN	Your eyes can deceive you.  Don't trust them. Stretch out with your feelings. You see, you can do it.
HAN	I call it luck.
OBI-WAN	In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.
HAN	Look, going good against remotes is one thing.  Going good against the living?  That's something else. Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.
===	===
LUKE	What's going on?
HAN	Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!
LUKE	What do you mean?  Where is it?
HAN	Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid.  It ain't there.  It's been totally blown away.
OBI-WAN	Destroyed... by the Empire!
HAN	The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.  It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've... There's another ship coming in.
OBI-WAN	No.  It's a short range fighter.
HAN	There aren't any bases around here.  Where did it come from?
===	===
LUKE	It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in big trouble.
HAN	Not if I can help it.  Chewie... jam it's transmissions.
OBI-WAN	It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range.
HAN	Not for long...
===	===
LUKE	Then he must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something...
HAN	Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.
===	===
LUKE	Look at him.  He's heading for that small moon.
HAN	I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.
OBI-WAN	That's no moon!  It's a space station.
HAN	It's too big to be a space station.
OBI-WAN	Turn the ship around!
HAN	Yeah, I think your right.  Full reverse!  Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
LUKE	Why are we still moving towards it?
HAN	We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in!
LUKE	But there's gotta be something you can do!
HAN	There's nothin' I can do about it, kid.  I'm in full power.  I'm going to have to shut down.  But they're not going to get me without a fight!
===	===
LUKE	Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.
HAN	I use them for smuggling.  I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them.  This is ridiculous.  Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam.
OBI-WAN	Leave that to me!
HAN	Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!
===	===
TROOPER	The ship's all yours.  If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately.  All right, let's go.
HAN	Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this?
===	===
LUKE	You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.
HAN	Bring them on!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
OBI-WAN	I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone.
HAN	Whatever you say.  I've done more than I bargained for on this trip already.
OBI-WAN	They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.  Your destiny lies along a different path from mine.  The Force will be with you ... always!
HAN	Boy you said it, Chewie. Where did you dig up that old fossil?
LUKE	Ben is a great man.
HAN	Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.
LUKE	I didn't hear you give any ideas...
HAN	Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for them to pick us up...
LUKE	The princess?  She's here?
HAN	Princess?
LUKE	Where... where is she?
HAN	Princess?  What's going on?
LUKE	Oh, no!  We've got to do something.
HAN	What are you talking about?
LUKE	The droid belongs to her.  She's the one in the message.  We've got to help her.
HAN	Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.  The old man wants us to wait right here.
LUKE	But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?
HAN	I'm not going anywhere.
LUKE	They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured.  Now all you want to do is stay.
HAN	Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.
LUKE	But they're going to kill her!
HAN	Better her than me...
LUKE	She's rich.
HAN	Rich?
LUKE	Yes.  Rich, powerful!  Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...
HAN	What?
LUKE	Well more wealth that you can imagine.
HAN	I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!
LUKE	You'll get it!
HAN	I better!
LUKE	You will...
HAN	All right, kid.  But you'd better be right about this!
LUKE	All right.
HAN	What's your plan?
LUKE	Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders there will you? Okay.  Now, I'm going to put these on you. Okay.  Han, you put these on.
HAN	Don't worry, Chewie.  I think I know what he has in mind.
LUKE	Lock the door!
HAN	And hope they don't have blasters.
===	===
LUKE	Why didn't you say so before?
HAN	I did say so before!
===	===
OFFICER	I wasn't notified.  I'll have to clear it.
HAN	Look out!  He's loose!
LUKE	He's going to pull us all apart.
HAN	Go get him! We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in. Here it is... cell twenty-one- eight-seven.  You go get her.  I'll hold them here. Everything is under control. Situation normal.
INTERCOM VOICE	What happened?
HAN	Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction.  But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now.  We're fine.  We're all fine here, now, thank you.  How are you?
INTERCOM VOICE	We're sending a squad up.
HAN	Uh, uh, negative, negative.  We had a reactor leak here now.  Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak... very dangerous.
INTERCOM VOICE	Who is this?  What's your operating number?
HAN	Boring conversation anyway. Luke!  We're going to have company!
===	===
LEIA	Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.
HAN	Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness.
===	===
LUKE	There isn't any other way out.
HAN	I can't hold them off forever! Now what?
LEIA	This is some rescue.  When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?
HAN	He's the brains, sweetheart.
LUKE	Well, I didn't...
HAN	What the hell are you doing?
LEIA	Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise guy.
HAN	Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell!  Get in there and don't worry about it. Wonderful girl!  Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.  Get in there!
===	===
LEIA	Put that thing away!  You're going to get us all killed.
HAN	Absolutely, Your Worship.  Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here.  You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.
LEIA	It could be worse...
HAN	It's worse.
LUKE	There's something alive in here!
HAN	That's your imagination.
LUKE	Something just moves past my leg! Look!  Did you see that?
HAN	What?
LUKE	Help!
HAN	Luke!  Luke!  Luke!
LUKE	Blast it, will you!  My gun's jammed.
HAN	Where?
LUKE	Anywhere!  Oh!!
HAN	Luke!  Luke!
LUKE	I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared...
HAN	I've got a very bad feeling about this.
===	===
LUKE	Threepio!  Come in, Threepio! Threepio!
HAN	Get to the top!
===	===
LUKE	Well, let's get moving!
HAN	Where are you going?
LEIA	No, wait.  They'll hear!
HAN	Come here, you big coward! Chewie!  Come here!
LEIA	Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you.  Okay?
HAN	Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight!  I take orders from one person!  Me!
LEIA	It's a wonder you're still alive. Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?
HAN	No reward is worth this.
===	===
LEIA	You came in that thing?  You're braver that I thought.
HAN	Nice!  Come on!
FIRST TROOPER	It's them!  Blast them!
HAN	Get back to the ship!
===	===
LUKE	Is the ship all right?
HAN	Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission.
===	===
LUKE	No!
HAN	Come on!
LEIA	Come on!  Luke, its too late!
HAN	Blast the door!  Kid!
===	===
LEIA	There wasn't anything you could have done.
HAN	Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet!
===	===
LEIA	We've lost lateral controls.
HAN	Don't worry, she'll hold together. You hear me, baby?  Hold together!
===	===
LUKE	Got him!  I got him!
HAN	Great kid!  Don't get cocky.
===	===
LEIA	That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, they let us go.  It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.
HAN	Easy... you call that easy?
LEIA	Their tracking us!
HAN	Not this ship, sister.
LEIA	At least the information in Artoo is still intact.
HAN	What's so important?  What's he carrying?
LEIA	The technical readouts of that battle station.  I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found.  It's not over yet!
HAN	It is for me, sister!  Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess.  I expect to be well paid.  I'm in it for the money!
LUKE	I care! So... what do you think of her, Han?
HAN	I'm trying not to, kid!
LUKE	Good...
HAN	Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me...
===	===
LUKE	So... you got your reward and you're just leaving then?
HAN	That's right, yeah!  I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff.  Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you?  Why don't you come with us?  You're pretty good in a fight.  I could use you.
LUKE	Come on!  Why don't you take a look around?  You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.
HAN	What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?  Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage.  It's more like suicide.
LUKE	All right.  Well, take care of yourself, Han... guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?
HAN	Hey, Luke... may the Force be with you! What're you lookin' at?  I know what I'm doing.
===	===
LEIA	Luke!  Luke!  Luke!
HAN	Hey!  Hey!
LUKE	I knew you'd come back!  I just knew it!
HAN	Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the reward.
===	===
BOUSHH	Just relax for a moment. You're free of the carbonite. Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
HAN	I can't see.
BOUSHH	You eyesight will return in time.
HAN	Where am I?
BOUSHH	Jabba's palace.
HAN	Who are you?
LEIA	Someone who loves you.
HAN	Leia!
LEIA	I gotta get you out of here.
HAN	What's that? I know that laugh. Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault.
JABBA	It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but now you're Bantha fodder.
HAN	Look...
JABBA	Take him away!
HAN	Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be a fool!
===	===
LUKE	Han!
HAN	Luke!
LUKE	Are you all right?
HAN	Fine. Together again, huh?
LUKE	Wouldn't miss it.
HAN	How are we doing?
LUKE	The same as always.
HAN	That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
C-3PO	Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
HAN	Good, I hate long waits.
C-3PO	You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.
HAN	Doesn't sound so bad.
C-3PO	In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
HAN	On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
===	===
LUKE	There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
HAN	You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
LUKE	Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
HAN	Oh... great!
===	===
LANDO	Han! Chewie?
HAN	Lando! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
===	===
LANDO	Lower it!
HAN	I'm trying! Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping. Grab it! L--Lando. Grab! Grab it! Almost... You almost got it!
LANDO	Hold it! Whoa!
HAN	Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie. Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
LANDO	No, wait! I thought you were blind!
HAN	It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
LANDO	All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
HAN	Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!
===	===
LEIA	That's all any of us can see.
HAN	Then I guess I'm getting better. I've got to hand it to you, kid, you were pretty good out there.
LUKE	I had a lot of help. Think nothing of it.
HAN	No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest thing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide awake nothing!
LUKE	I'll see you back at the fleet.
HAN	Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
LUKE	I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
HAN	(looking dubiously at Lando, obviously remembering his friend's betrayal and subsequent aide) Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
===	===
LUKE	I will.
HAN	Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one.
===	===
LANDO	Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
HAN	Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack.
LANDO	I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.
HAN	Well, who says they didn't.  But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember?
ACKBAR	You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor. General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack
HAN	Good luck. You're gonna need it.
GENERAL MADINE	General Solo, is your strike team assembled?
HAN	Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle. Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you. That's one.
LUKE	Ask me again sometime.
HAN	Luke.
===	===
LANDO	All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?
HAN	Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch.
LANDO	Look, would you get going, you pirate. Good luck.
HAN	You, too.
===	===
LUKE	Yeah, she's comin' up.
HAN	No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
LEIA	Hey, are you awake?
HAN	Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
LEIA	Come on, General, let's move.
HAN	Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
C-3PO	Here we go again.
HAN	All right, hang on.
===	===
CONTROLLER	We have you on our screen now. Please identify.
HAN	Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.
CONTROLLER	Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage.
HAN	Transmission commencing.
LEIA	Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
HAN	It'll work. It'll work.
LUKE	Vader's on that ship.
HAN	Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance. I don't know.  Fly casual.
LUKE	I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
HAN	It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.
===	===
CONTROLLER	Shuttle Tydirium, deactivation of the shield will commence immediately. Follow your present course.
HAN	Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.
===	===
LEIA	Shall we try and go around?
HAN	It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
===	===
LUKE	Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
HAN	Hey... it's me.
LUKE	I see them. Wait, Leia! Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch!
HAN	Hey, wait! Ahhh!
===	===
C-3PO	Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!
HAN	Luke! Where's Leia?
LUKE	What? She didn't come back?
HAN	I thought she was with you.
LUKE	We got separated. Hey, we better go look for her.
HAN	Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
===	===
C-3PO	I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.
HAN	I hope she's alright. What, Chewie? What? Chewie!
===	===
LUKE	Chewie, wa-wait!  Don't!
HAN	Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.
LUKE	Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. (trying to free an arm) Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
HAN	Yeah, sure.
C-3PO	Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-op!!
HAN	Wha--?  Hey!  Point that thing someplace else. Hey!
C-3PO	Oh, yes, Master Luke!  Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication.
HAN	What are you telling them?
C-3PO	Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
HAN	Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
C-3PO	I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
HAN	Proper?!
C-3PO	It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
HAN	Why, you-- My mistake. He's an old friend of mine.
===	===
C-3PO	I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
HAN	Leia!
LEIA	But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free.
HAN	Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
===	===
C-3PO	Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that.
HAN	What's going on?
C-3PO	Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.
HAN	Just what I always wanted. Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie. (to Wicket) Thank you. Okay.
C-3PO	He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator.
HAN	Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back. And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day.
===	===
LUKE	Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.
HAN	Hey, what's goin' on?
LEIA	Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.
HAN	Nothing?  Come on, tell me.  What's goin' on?
LEIA	I...I can't tell you.
HAN	Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?
LEIA	I...
HAN	Ahhh... I'm sorry.
===	===
LEIA	The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
HAN	Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
===	===
LEIA	Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm.
HAN	Then we'll do it real quiet-like.
===	===
LEIA	Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
HAN	Charges!  Come on, come on!
===	===
LEIA	The code's changed. We need Artoo!
HAN	Here's the terminal.
===	===
C-3PO	We're coming!
HAN	Come on! Come on!
C-3PO	Oh, Artoo, hurry! My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
HAN	Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
===	===
C-3PO	Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
HAN	Let's see.
STORMTROOPER	Don't move!
HAN	I love you.
STORMTROOPER	Hands up! Stand up!
HAN	Stay back. Chewie!  Get down here!  She's wounded!  No, wait....  I got an idea.
===	===
LUKE	Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you read me?
HAN	Loud and clear, kid. What's up?
LUKE	Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings.
HAN	There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. The sensors are placed. I'm going back.
===	===
RIEEKAN	Solo?
HAN	No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place. You'll know if anything comes around.
RIEEKAN	Commander Skywalker reported in yet?
HAN	No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.
RIEEKAN	With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
HAN	General, I've got to leave. I can't stay anymore.
RIEEKAN	I'm sorry to hear that.
HAN	Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut, I'm a dead man.
RIEEKAN	A death mark's not an easy thing to live with. You're a good fighter, Solo. I hate to lose you.
HAN	Thank you, General. Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it.
LEIA	That's right.
HAN	Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess.
===	===
LEIA	Han!
HAN	Yes, Your Highnessness?
LEIA	I thought you decided to stay.
HAN	Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
LEIA	Han, we need you!
HAN	We?
LEIA	Yes.
HAN	Oh, what about you need?
LEIA	I need? I don't know what you're talking about.
HAN	You probably don't.
LEIA	And what precisely am I supposed to know?
HAN	Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
LEIA	Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader...
HAN	No! That's not it. Come on. Aahhh -- uh huh! Come on.
LEIA	You're imagining things.
HAN	Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?
LEIA	I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.
HAN	I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!
===	===
C-3PO	Excuse me, sir.
HAN	Put them back together right now.
C-3PO	Might I have a word with you, please?
HAN	What do you want?
C-3PO	Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator.
HAN	I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.
C-3PO	Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is.
HAN	I don't know where he is.
C-3PO	Nobody knows where he is.
HAN	"What do you mean, ""nobody knows""?"
C-3PO	Well, uh, you see...
HAN	Deck Officer. Deck Officer!
DECK OFFICER	Yes, sir?
HAN	Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?
DECK OFFICER	I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in through the south entrance.
HAN	It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out there.
C-3PO	Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on?
HAN	Why not?
===	===
DECK OFFICER	Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't come in through the south entrance. He might have forgotten to check in.
HAN	Not likely. Are the speeders ready?
DECK OFFICER	Not yet. We're having some trouble adapting them to the cold.
HAN	Then we'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
DECK OFFICER	Sir, the temperature's dropping too rapidly.
HAN	That's right. And my friends out in it.
DECK OFFICER	Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you reach the first marker.
HAN	Then I'll see you in hell!
===	===
LUKE	Ben...Ben.
HAN	Luke! Luke! Don't do this, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here. Not much time.
LUKE	Ben...Ben...
HAN	Hang on, kid.
LUKE	Dagobah system...
HAN	Whew...
LUKE	Dagobah...
HAN	This may smell bad, kid...
LUKE	Yoda...
HAN	...but it will keep you warm...til I get the shelter built. (struggling to get Luke in the carcass) Ooh...I thought they smelled bad on the outside!
===	===
ZEV	This is Rouge Two. this is Rouge Two. Captain Solo, so you copy? Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rouge Two.
HAN	Good morning. Nice of you guys to drop by.
===	===
C-3PO	Master Luke, sir, it's good to see you fully functional again. Artoo expresses his relief, also.
HAN	How are you feeling, kid? You don't look so bad to me. In fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark.
LUKE	Thanks to you.
HAN	That's two you owe me, junior. Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer.
LEIA	I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield.
HAN	That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.
LEIA	I don't know where you get you delusions, laser brain.
HAN	Laugh it up, fuzz ball. But you didn't see us alone in the south passage. She expressed her true feelings for me.
LEIA	My...! Why, you stuck up,...half-witted,...scruffy-looking... nerf-herder!
HAN	Who's scruffy-looking?  I must have hit her pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?
ANNOUNCER	Headquarters personnel, report to command center.
HAN	Take it easy.
===	===
LEIA	Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke.
HAN	It could be a speeder, one of ours.
C-3PO	Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code.
HAN	It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let's check it out.
===	===
LEIA	What was it?
HAN	Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct.
LEIA	An Imperial probe droid.
HAN	It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here.
===	===
LUKE	Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?
HAN	Hi, kid.  There's got to be a reason for it. Check it at the other end. Wait a second. (to Luke) You all right?
LUKE	Yeah.
HAN	Be careful.
===	===
LEIA	Why are you still here?
HAN	I heard the command center had been hit.
LEIA	You got your clearance to leave.
HAN	Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm going to get you to your ship.
ANNOUNCER	Imperial troops have entered the base.
HAN	Come on...that's it.
===	===
C-3PO	Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop! How typical.
HAN	Come on.
===	===
LEIA	Would it helped if I got out and pushed?
HAN	It might.
===	===
LEIA	The bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
HAN	This baby's got a few surprises left in her, sweetheart.
===	===
LEIA	Someday you're going to be wrong, and I hope I'm there to see it.
HAN	Punch it!
===	===
LEIA	Saw what?
HAN	Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us.
C-3PO	Sir, sir! Might I suggest...
HAN	Shut him up or shut him down!  Check the deflector shield! Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them.
===	===
LEIA	They're getting closer!
HAN	Oh yeah? Watch this.
LEIA	Watch what?
HAN	I think we're in trouble.
C-3PO	If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed!
HAN	We're in trouble!
===	===
LEIA	Han, get up here!
HAN	Come on, Chewie!
===	===
LEIA	Asteroids!
HAN	Oh, no! Chewie, set two-seven-one.
LEIA	What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid field?
HAN	They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?
C-3PO	Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one.
HAN	Never tell me the odds!
===	===
LEIA	I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
HAN	I'm not going to argue with that.
C-3PO	Pulverized?
HAN	I'm going in closer to one of the big ones.
===	===
C-3PO	Oh, this is suicide!
HAN	There. That looks pretty good.
LEIA	What looks pretty good?
HAN	Yeah. That'll do nicely.
===	===
LEIA	I hope you know what you're doing.
HAN	Yeah, me too.
===	===
C-3PO	Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but...does that include shutting me down, too?
HAN	No, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.
C-3PO	Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable.
HAN	Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these things.  Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive.
LEIA	Let go.
HAN	Sshh!
LEIA	Let go, please.
HAN	Don't get excited.
LEIA	Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited.
HAN	Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else.
===	===
C-3PO	Oh, where is Artoo when I need him? Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.
HAN	Well, of course I'll have to replace it. Here! And Chewie... ...I think we'd better replace the negative power coupling. Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help.
LEIA	Would you please stop calling me that?
HAN	Sure, Leia.
LEIA	Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes.
HAN	I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though. (he watches her reaction) Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right.
LEIA	Occasionally  maybe...when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
HAN	Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that.
LEIA	Stop that.
HAN	Stop what?
LEIA	Stop that! My hands are dirty.
HAN	My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of?
LEIA	Afraid?
HAN	You're trembling.
LEIA	I'm not trembling.
HAN	You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life.
LEIA	I happen to like nice men.
HAN	I'm a nice man.
C-3PO	Sir, sir! I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling.
HAN	Thank you. Thank you very much.
===	===
C-3PO	Sir, if I may venture an opinion...
HAN	I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio.
LEIA	There's something out there.
HAN	Where?
C-3PO	There it is. Listen! Listen!
HAN	I'm going out there.
LEIA	Are you crazy?!
HAN	I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let something tear it apart.
===	===
LEIA	This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock at all.
HAN	There's an awful lot of moisture in here.
LEIA	I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this.
HAN	Yeah. Watch out! Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables.
LEIA	Mynocks?
HAN	Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more.
C-3PO	Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly thing. Shoo! Shoo!
HAN	Wait a minute...
===	===
LEIA	The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to...
HAN	No time to discuss this as a committee.
===	===
LEIA	You can't make the jump to light-speed in this asteroid field...
HAN	Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off!
C-3PO	Look!
HAN	I see it, I see it.
LEIA	The cave is collapsing.
HAN	This is no cave.
===	===
LEIA	No light-speed?
HAN	It's not my fault.
C-3PO	Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
HAN	Turn her around. I said turn her around! I'm going to put all power in the front shield.
===	===
C-3PO	Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. (Chewie growls) No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me?
HAN	The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw.
C-3PO	I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough...
HAN	Thank you.
LEIA	What did you have in mind for your next move?
HAN	Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away.
LEIA	With the rest of the garbage. Then what?
HAN	Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any ideas?
LEIA	No. Where are we?
HAN	The Anoat system.
LEIA	Anoat system. There's not much there.
HAN	No. Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando.
LEIA	Lando system?
HAN	Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian. He's a card player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him.
LEIA	Thanks.
HAN	Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it.
LEIA	A mining colony?
HAN	Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me.
LEIA	Can you trust him?
HAN	No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that. Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach!
===	===
LEIA	I thought you knew this person.
HAN	Well, that was a long time ago. I'm sure he's forgotten about that.
INTERCOM VOICE	Permission granted to land on Platform Three-two-seven.
HAN	Thank you. There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me.
===	===
LEIA	I don't like this.
HAN	Well, what would you like?
C-3PO	Well, they did let us land.
HAN	Look, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Trust me.
===	===
LANDO	What are you doing here?
HAN	Ahh...repairs. I thought you could help me out.
LANDO	What have you done to my ship?
HAN	Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square.
LANDO	Welcome, Leia.
HAN	All right, all right, you old smoothie.
LANDO	What's wrong with the Falcon?
HAN	Hyperdrive.
LANDO	I'll get my people to work on it.
HAN	Good.
===	===
LANDO	Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties...(catches Han grinning at him) What's so funny?
HAN	You. Listen to you -- you sound like a businessman, a responsible leader. Who'd have thought that, huh?
LANDO	You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things.
HAN	Yeah.
===	===
LEIA	The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost.
HAN	Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out.
LEIA	I don't trust Lando.
HAN	Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides, we'll soon be gone.
===	===
LEIA	What happened?
HAN	Where? Found him in a junk pile?
LEIA	Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
HAN	Lando's got people who can fix him.
LANDO	Will you join me for a little refreshment? Everyone's invited, of course. Having trouble with you droid?
HAN	No. No problem. Why?
===	===
LANDO	No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be noticed...which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves.
HAN	Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down?
===	===
LANDO	I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. I'm sorry.
HAN	I'm sorry, too.
===	===
C-3PO	Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not right because now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough...
HAN	I feel terrible.
LEIA	Why are they doing this?
HAN	They never even asked me any questions.
LEIA	Lando.
HAN	Get out of here, Lando!
LANDO	Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.
HAN	Over to you?
LANDO	He doesn't want you at all. He's after somebody called Skywalker.
HAN	Luke?
LANDO	Well, he's on his way.
HAN	Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you? My friend!
LANDO	Stop! I've done all I can do. I'm sorry I couldn't do better, but I have my own problems.
HAN	Yeah, you're a real hero.
===	===
C-3PO	If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish.
HAN	What's going on...buddy?
C-3PO	Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...!
HAN	Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop!
C-3PO	Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die.
HAN	Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey! Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess -- you have to take care of her. You hear me?
LEIA	I love you!
HAN	I know.
