Certainly.
Oh, Anakin! Thank goodness, you're back.
I missed you, Padme. I've missed you so.
There were whispers . . . that you'd been killed. I've been living with unbearable dread.
I'm back, I'm all right. It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been ... If the Chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges.
Wait, not here . . .
Yes, here! I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they know we're married.
Anakin, don't say things like that. You're important to the Republic ... to ending this war. I love you more than anything, but I won't let you give up your life as a Jedi for me . . .
I've given my life to the Jedi order, but I'd only give up my life, for you.
I wouldn't like that. I wouldn't like that one bit. Patience, my handsome Jedi . . . Come to me later.
Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on?
I'm just excited to see you.
That's not it. I sense more . . . what is it?
Nothing . . . nothing . . .
You're frightened.  Tell me what's going on!
You've been gone five months . . . it's been very hard for me. I've never felt so alone. There's . . .
. . . Is there someone else?
No! Why do you think that? Your jealousy upsets me so much, Anakin. I do nothing to betray you, yet you still don't trust me. Nothing has changed.
I'm afraid of losing you, Padme . . . that's all.
I will never stop loving you, Anakin. My only fear is losing you.
It's just that I've never seen you like this . . .
Something wonderful has happened. I'm . . . Annie, I'm pregnant.
That's . . . that's wonderful.
What are we going to do?
. . . every second I was thinking of you. Protecting the endless, nameless Outer Rim settlements became a torture . . . the battles were easy, the longing became unbearable . . . I've never been so happy as I am at this moment.
Annie, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We could go to the lake country where no one would know . . . where we would be safe. I could go early-and fix up the baby's room. I know the perfect spot, right by the gardens.
You are so beautiful!
It's only because I'm so in love . . .
No, it's because I'm so in love with you.
So love has blinded you?
Well, that's not exactly what I meant . . .
But it's probably true!
I haven't laughed in so long . . .
Neither have I.
Nothing . . . I remember when I gave this to you.
Anakin, how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other?
It was a dream.
Bad?
Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died.
And?
It was about you.
Tell me.
It was only a dream. You die in childbirth . . .
And the baby?
I don't know.
It was only a dream.
. . . I won't let this one become real, Padme.
Anakin, this baby will change our lives. I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate, and if the Council discovers you are the father, you will be expelled from the Jedi Order.
I know бн.
Anakin, do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?
Have you told him anything?
No, but he's your mentor, your best friend . . . he must suspect something.
He's been a father to me, but he's still on the Council. Don't tell him anything!
I won't, Anakin.
The decree was posted this morning.
Do you think he will dismantle the Senate?
It has become increasingly clear to many of us that the Chancellor has become an enemy of democracy.
I can't believe it has come to this! Chancellor Palpatine is one of my oldest advisors. He served as my Ambassador when I was Queen.
We can't sit around debating any longer, we have decided to do what we can to stop it. Senator Mon Mothma and I are putting together an organization . . .
Say no more. Senator Organa. I understand. At this point, it's better to leave some things unsaid.
That means those closest to you . . . even family ... no one can be told.
Agreed.
Rest well. My Lady.
I'll be up in a while.
Is there anything I might do for you, my lady?
Yes, make sure all the security droids are working. Thank you, Threepio.
Beautiful, isn't it?
You startled me.
How are you feeling?
He keeps kicking.
He?! Why do you think it's a boy?
My motherly intuition.
Whoa! With a kick that strong, it's got to be a girl.
I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I'm so proud of you.
I may be on the Council, but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master.
Patience. In time, they will recognize your skills.
They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power, that's the problem.
Anakin . . .
Sometimes, I wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.
Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?
What do you mean?
What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?
I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a Separatist!
Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.
Don't ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I'm not your errand boy. I'm not anyone's errand boy!
What is it?
Nothing.
Don't do this . . . don't shut me out. Let me help you.
You can't help me . . . I'm trying to help you. I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me.
I sense there are things you are not telling me. Hold me . . . like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long ago . . . when there was nothing but our love ... No politics, no plotting ... no war.
Has Anakin been to see you?
Several times . . . I was so happy to hear he was accepted on the Jedi Council.
I know ... he deserves it. He is impatient, strong willed, very opinionated, but truly gifted.
You're not just here to say hello. Something is wrong, isn't it?
You should be a Jedi, Padme.
You're not very good at hiding your feelings.
It's Anakin . . . He's becoming moody and detached. He's been put in a difficult position as the Chancellor's representative . . . but I think it's more than that. I was hoping he may have talked to you.
Why would he talk to me about his work?
Neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either.
Don't give me that look.
I know how he feels about you.
What did he say?
Nothing. He didn't have to.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I know you both too well. I can see you two are in love. Padme, I'm worried about him. I fear your relationship has confused him. He's changed considerably since we returned . . . Padme, I'm not telling the Council about any of this. I ... I hope I didn't upset you. We're all friends, I care about both of you . . .
Thank you, Obi-Wan.
We are hoping to form an alliance in the Senate to stop the Chancellor from further subverting the constitution, that's all.
I know a Jedi I feel it would be wise to consult.
We don't know where the Jedi stand in all this.
I only wish to discuss this with one . . . one I trust.
Going against the Chancellor without the support of the Jedi is risky.
The Jedi aren't any happier with the situation than we are . . .
Save your energy.
I can't!
I sense someone familiar . . . Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?
He came by this morning.
What did he want?
He's worried about you.
You told him about us, didn't you?
He's your best friend, Anakin. He says you're under a lot of stress.
And he's not?
You have been moody lately.
I'm not moody . . .
Anakin! Don't do this again.
I don't know ... I feel . . . lost.
Lost? What do you mean? You're always so sure of yourself. I don't understand.
Obi-Wan and the Council don't trust me.
They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan loves you as a son.
Something's happening . . . I'm not the Jedi I should be. I am one of the most powerful Jedi, but I'm not satisfied ... I want more, and I know I shouldn't.
You expect too much of yourself.
I have found a way to save you.
Save me?
From my nightmares.
Is that what's bothering you?
I won't lose you, Padme.
I'm not going to die in childbirth, Annie. I promise you.
No, I promise you! I am becoming so powerful with my new knowledge of the Force, I will be able to keep you from dying.
You don't need more power, Anakin. I believe you can protect me against anything, just as you are.
I understand your reservations completely, Senator, and I assure you the appointment of Governors will in no way compete with the duties of the Senate.
May I take it then, that there will be no further amendments to the Constitution?
I want this terrible conflict to end as much as you do, My Lady, and when it does I guarantee an immediate return to democracy . . .
You are pursuing a diplomatic solution to the war, then.
I have said I will do what is right, that should be enough for your . . . committee.
On behalf of the "delegation of two thousand," I thank you, Chancellor.
You do know, don't you, if the Jedi destroy me, any chance of saving her will be lost.
I truly, deeply love you. Before I die. I want you to know.
Hush! Not so loud!
Are you all right? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi Temple . . . you can see the smoke from here.
I'm fine. I'm fine. I came to see if you and the baby are safe.
Captain Typho's here, we're safe. What's happening?
The situation is not good. The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic . . .
I can't believe that!
Something important is going on! I heard a rumor they are going to banish all droids. Shhhhhh . . . not so loud. Whatever it is, we'll be the last to know.
Anakin, what are you going to do?
I will not betray the Republic . . . my loyalties lie with the Chancellor and with the Senate . . . and with you.
What about Obi-Wan?
I don't know . . . Many Jedi have been killed. We can only hope that he's remained loyal to the Chancellor.
How could this have happened?
The Republic is unstable, Padme. The Jedi aren't the only ones trying to take advantage of the situation. There are also traitors in the Senate.
What are you saying?
You need to distance yourself from your friends in the Senate. The Chancellor said they will be dealt with when this conflict is over.
What if they start an inquisition? I've opposed this war. What will you do if I become a suspect?
That won't happen. I won't let it.
Oh, Anakin, I'm afraid.
Have faith, my love. Everything will soon be set right. The Chancellor has given me a very important mission. The Separatists have gathered in the Mustafar system. I'm going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return . . . things will be different, I promise. Please, wait for me.
I will.
Well, he is under a lot of stress, Artoo. Take care, my little friend. My Lady, is there anything I might do?
No thank you, Threepio.
A snack, perhaps?
No.
I was held up. What's happening?
The Chancellor has been elaborating on a plot by the Jedi, to overthrow the Senate.
That's not true!
He's been presenting evidence all afternoon.
The war is over.  The Separatists have been defeated,  and the Jedi rebellion has been foiled. We stand on the threshold of a new beginning.
Well, this is the moment we discover if he intends to return the Republic to a democracy.
In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society which I assure you will last for ten thousand years. An empire that will continue to be ruled by this august body, and a sovereign ruler chosen for life . . . An empire ruled by the majority . . . Ruled by a new constitution . . .
So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause . . .
We cannot let this happen.
Not now! There will be a time.
Yes . . . right after the attack on the Jedi Temple.
Master Kenobi . . . Oh, Obi-Wan, thank goodness . . . you're alive.
The Republic has fallen. Padme . . . The Jedi Order is no more . . .
I know, it's hard to believe everything to which we've dedicated our lives is gone.
I believe we have been part of a plot hundreds of years in the making.
The Senate is still intact, there is some hope.
No. Padme . . . It's over . . . The Sith now rule the galaxy as they did before the Republic.
The Sith!?!
I'm here looking for Anakin . . . When was the last time you saw him?
Yesterday.
And do you know where he is now?
No.
Padme, I need your help. He's in grave danger.
From the Sith?
From himself . . . Padme, Anakin has turned to the dark side.
You're wrong! How could you even say that?
I have seen a security hologram of him killing younglings.
Not Anakin! He couldn't!
He was deceived by a lie. We all were. It appears that the Chancellor is behind everything, including the war. Palpatine is the Sith Lord we've been looking for. After the death of Count Dooku, Anakin became his new apprentice.
I don't believe you ... I can't.
Padme, I must find him.
You're going to kill him, aren't you?
He has become a very great threat.
I can't . . .
My Lady, let me come with you.
There is no danger. The fighting is over, and . . . this is personal.
As you wish, My Lady . . . but I strongly disagree.
I'll be all right, Captain. This is something I must do myself. Besides, Threepio will look after me.
Padme, I saw your ship . . .
Oh, Anakin!
It's all right, you're safe now. What are you doing out here?
I was so worried about you. Obi-Wan told me terrible things.
What things?
He said you have turned to the dark side . . . that you killed younglings.
Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.
He cares about us.
Us??!
He knows . . . He wants to help you.
Is Obi-Wan going to protect you? He can't ... he can't help you. He's not strong enough.
Anakin, all I want is your love.
Love won't save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that.
At what cost? You are a good person. Don't do this.
I won't lose you the way I lost my mother! I've become more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of and I've done it for you. To protect you.
Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else behind while we still can.
Don't you see, we don't have to run away anymore. I have brought peace to the Republic. I am more powerful than the Chancellor. I can overthrow him, and together you and I can rule the galaxy. Make things the way we want them to be.
I don't believe what I'm hearing . . . Obi-Wan was right. You've changed.
I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me. Don't you turn against me.
I don't know you anymore. Anakin, you're breaking my heart. I'll never stop loving you, but you are going down a path I
Because of Obi-Wan?
Because of what you've done . . . what you plan to do. Stop, stop now. Come back! I love you.
Liar!
No!
You're with him. You've betrayed me! You brought him here to kill me!
NO! Anakin. I swear ... I ...
It's a boy.
Luke . . .
... and a girl.
. . . Leia.
You have twins, Padme They need you . . . hang on.
I can't . . .
Save your energy.
Obi-Wan . . . there . . . is good in him. I know there is ... still . . .
It is with great surprise and joy the chair recognises the Senator from Naboo, Padme Amidala.
Less than an hour ago, an assassination attempt was made against my life. One of my bodyguards and six  others were ruthlessly and senselessly murdered. I was the target but, more importantly, I believe this security measure before you, was the target. I have led the opposition to build an army... but there is someone in this body who will stop at nothing to assure it's passage... I warn you, if you vote to create this army, war will follow. I have experienced the misery of war first-hand; I do not wish to do it again. Wake up, Senators... you must wake up! If you offer the separatists violence, they can only show us violence in return! Many will lose their lives. All will lose their freedom. This decision could very well destroy the very foundation of our great Republic. I pray you do not let fear push you into a disastrous decision. Vote down this security measure, which is nothing less than a declaration of war! Does anyone here want that? I cannot believe they do.
With you the force is strong... young Senator. To see you alive brings warm feeling to my heart.
Thank you, Master Yoda. Do you have any idea who was behind the attack?
Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners, on the moons of Naboo.
I don't wish to disagree but I think that Count Dooku was behind it.
Count Dooku has always avoided any kind of conflict. It appears he has no desire to start a war. Why would he kill you? To what end?
I don't know, but everything in my being tells me he was behind it...
Do you think that is a wise use of manpower during these stressful times?
Chancellor, if I may comment, I do not believe the...
..."situation is that serious." No, but I do, Senator.
Chancellor, please! I don't want any more guards!
You must remember him, M'Lady... he watched over you during the blockade conflict.
This is not necessary, Chancellor.
It's a great pleasure to see you again, M'Lady.
It has been far too long Master Kenobi. I'm so glad our paths have crossed again... but I must warn you that I think your presence here is unnecessary.
I'm sure the Jedi Council have their reasons.
Annie?? My goodness you've grown.
So have you... grown more beautiful, I mean... and much shorter... for a Senator, I mean.
Oh Annie, you'll always be that little boy I knew on Tatooine.
I am very grateful you are here, Master Kenobi. The situation is more dangerous than the Senator will admit.
I don't need more security, I need answers. I want to know who is trying to kill me.
We will do as the Council has instructed, and you will learn your place, young one.
Perhaps with merely your presence, the mysteries surrounding this threat will be revealed.  Now if you will excuse me I will retire.
Yousa betchen mesa bottums.
What?!
Oh, pardone-ay, Senator. I mean, I am honoured to accept this heavy burden. I take on this responsibility with deep humility tinged with an overwhelming pride. It is not every day that I am called upon to...
You're a good friend, Jar Jar. I don't wish to hold you up. I'm sure you have a great deal to do.
Of course, M'lady.
I do not like this idea of hiding.
Don't worry. Now that the Council has ordered an investigation, it won't take Master Obi-Wan long to find that bounty hunter.
I haven't worked for a year to defeat the "Military Creation Act" not to be here when its fate is decided.
Sometimes we have to let go of our pride and do what is requested of us.
Pride?!? Annie, you're young, and you don't have a very firm grip on politics. I suggest you reserve your opinions for some other time.
Sorry, M'lady. I was only trying to...
Annie! No!
Please don't call me that.
What?
Annie...
I've always called you that... it is your name, isn't it?
It's Anakin. When you say Annie it's like I'm still a little boy... and I'm not.
I'm sorry, Anakin. It's impossible to deny you've... ...that you've grown up.
Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it...
Mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like. It's the only way we grow.
Don't get me wrong... Obi-Wan is a great mentor. As wise as Master Yoda and as powerful as Master Windu. I am truly thankful to be his apprentice. Only... although I'm a Padawan learner, in some ways... a lot of ways... I'm ahead of him. I'm ready for the trials. I know I am! He knows it too. He believes I'm too unpredictable... Other Jedi my age have gone through the trials and made it... I know I started my training late... but he won't let me move on.
That must be frustrating.
It's worse... he's overly critical. He never listens! He just doesn't understand! It's not fair!
I'm sorry... You sounded exactly like that little boy I once knew, when he didn't get his way.
I'm not whining! I'm not.
I didn't say it to hurt you.
I know...
Anakin... Don't try to grow up too fast.
I am grown up. You said it yourself.
Please don't look at me like that.
Why not?
Because I can see what you're thinking.
Ahh... so, you have Jedi powers too?
It makes me feel uncomfortable.
Be safe, m'lady.
Thank you, Captain. Take good care of Dorme... the threat's on you two now.
He'll be safe with me.
You'll be fine.
It's not me, M'Lady. I worry about you. What if they realise I'm not you?
Then my Jedi protector will have to prove how grown up he is.
I will get to the bottom of this plot quickly, M'Lady. You'll be back here in no time.
I will be most grateful for your speed, Master Jedi.
Time to go.
I know.
May the Force be with you, Master.
Suddenly, I'm afraid...
I'm kinda scared too. This is my first assignment on my own.
There's nothing to worry about... we have Artoo with us.
No, no, Mom, no... What?
You seemed to be having a nightmare. Are you hungry?
Thank you.
We went into lightspeed a while ago.
I look forward to seeing Naboo again. I've thought about it every day since I left. It's by far the most beautiful place I've ever seen...
You were just a little boy then. It may not be as you remember it; time changes your perception.
I think time has given me much more mature feelings to enhance my perception.
It must be difficult having sworn your life to the Jedi... not being able to visit the places you like... or do the things you like...
Or be with the people I love.
Are you allowed to love? I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.
Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love, is central to a Jedi's life, so you might say we're encouraged to love.
You have changed so much
You haven't changed a bit. You're exactly the way I remember you in my dreams. I doubt if Naboo has changed much either.
It hasn't...
I can't wait to breathe the sweet breeze that comes off the rolling hills. Whenever I try to visualise the Force, those hills are what I see. I love Naboo.
Were you dreaming about you mother earlier, weren't you?
If I grew up here, I don't think I'd ever leave.
I doubt that.
No, really. When I started my training, I was very homesick and very lonely. This city and my Mom were the only pleasant things I had to think about... The problem was, the more I thought about my Mom, the worse I felt. But I would feel better if I thought about the palace - the way it shimmers in the sunlight - the way the air always smells of flowers...
...and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls. The first time I saw the Capital, I was very young... I'd never seen a waterfall before. I though they were so beautiful... I never dreamed one day I'd live in the palace.
Well, tell me, did you dream of power and politics when you were a little girl?
No! That was the last thing I thought of. My dream was to help in the "Refugee Relief Movement." I never thought of running for elected office. But the more history I studied, the more I realised how much good politicians could do. So when I was eight, I joined the "Apprentice Legislators", then later on became a Senatorial advisor, with such a passion that, before I knew it, I was elected Queen. Partly because I scored so high on my education certificate, but for the most part it was my conviction that reform was possible. I wasn't the youngest Queen ever elected, but now that I think back on it, I'm not sure I was old enough. I'm not sure I was ready.
The people you served thought you did a good job. I heard they tried to amend the Constitution so you could stay in office.
Popular rule is not democracy, Annie. It gives the people what they want, not what they need. And, truthfully, I was relieved when my two terms were up. So were my parents. They worried About me during the blockade and couldn't wait for it all to be over. Actually, I was hoping to have a family by now... My sisters have the most amazing, wonderful kids... but when the Queen asked me to serve as Senator, I couldn't refuse her.
I agree! I think the Republic needs you... I'm glad you chose to serve. I feel things are going to happen in our generation that will change the galaxy in profound ways.
I think so too.
We've been worried about you. I'm so glad you're safe, Padme.
Thank you, Your Highness. I only Wish I could have served you better by staying on Coruscant for the vote.
How many systems have joined Count Dooku and the separatists?
About two hundred. And more are leaving the Republic every day. If the Senate votes to create an army, I'm sure it's going to push us into a civil war.
Do you see any way, through negotiations, to bring the separatists back into the Republic?
Not if they feel threatened. The separatists don't have an army, but if they are provoked, they will move to defend themselves. I'm sure of that. And with no time or money to build an army, my guess is they will turn to the Commerce Guilds or the Trade Federation for help.
The armies of commerce! Why has Nothing been done in the Senate to restrain them?
I'm afraid that, despite the Chancellor's best efforts, there are still many bureaucrats, judges, and even Senators on the payrolls of the Guilds.
Remember, Counsellor, the courts were able to reduce the Federation's armies. That's a move in the right direction.
There are rumours, Your Highness, that the Federation Army was not reduced as they were ordered.
We must keep our faith in the Republic. The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it.
Let's pray that day never comes.
What is your suggestion, Master Jedi?
Anakin's not a Jedi yet, Counsellor. He's still a Padawan learner. I was thinking...
Hey, hold on a minute!
Excuse me! I was thinking I would stay in the Lake Country. There are some places up there that are very isolated.
Excuse me?! I am in charge of security here, M'Lady.
Annie, my life is at risk, and this is my home. I know it very well... that is why we're here. I think it would be wise for you to take advantage of my knowledge in this instance.
Aunt Padme!! Aunt Padme!!
Ryoo!! Pooja!! I'm so happy to see you! This is Anakin. Anakin, this is Ryoo, and this is Pooja.
They're eating over at Jev Narran's later, Mom. They just had a snack. They'll be fine.
Anakin, this is my sister, Sola.
A little.
He's being polite, Mom. We're starving.
Well, this is exciting! Do you know, Anakin, you're the first boyfriend my sister's ever brought home?
Sola!! He isn't my boyfriend! He's a Jedi assigned by the Senate to protect me.
A bodyguard?! Oh, Padme! They didn't tell us it was that serious!
It's not, Mom, I promise. Anyway, Anakin's a friend. I've known him for years. Remember that little boy who was with the Jedi during the blockade crisis? He grew up.
Honey, when are you going to settle down? Haven't you had enough of that life? I certainly have!
Mom, I'm not in any danger.
...Yes... I'm afraid she is.
But not much.
Why haven't you told us about him?
What's there to talk about?  He's just a boy.
A boy? Have you seen the way he looks at you?
Sola - stop it!
It's obvious he has feelings for you. Are you saying, little baby sister, that you haven't noticed?
I'm not your baby sister, Sola. Anakin and I are friends... our relationship is strictly professional. Mom, would you tell her to stop it?
Well, maybe you haven't noticed the way he looks at you. I think you're afraid to.
Cut it out.
Sola's just concerned... we all are.
Oh, Mom, you're impossible. What I'm doing is important.
I just want to get there before dark. You still live at home.
I move around so much, I've never had a place of my own. Official residences have no warmth. I feel good here. I feel at home.
I never had a real home. Home was always where my Mom was. Is this you?
That was when I went with the Relief Group to Shadda-Bi-Boran. Their sun was imploding, and the planet was dying. I was helping to relocate the children. See that little one I'm holding? His name was N'a-kee-tula, which means sweethear. He was so full of life,. All those kids were. I did everything I could to save him, but he died... they all did. They were never able to adapt... to live off their native planet. My first day as an Apprentice Legislator. Notice the difference?
I do too. I guess it comes from growing up on a desert planet.
...We used to lie on the sand and let the sun dry us... and try to guess the names of the birds singing.
I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here everything's soft... and smooth...
There was a very old man who lived on the island. He used to make glass out of sand - and vases and necklaces out of the glass. They were magical.
Everything here is magical.
You could look into the glass and see the water. The way it ripples and moves. It looked so real... but it wasn't.
Sometimes, when you believe something to be real, it becomes real. Real enough, anyway...
I used to think if you looked too deeply into glass, you would lose yourself.
I think it's true...
I shouldn't have done that.
I'm sorry. When I'm around you, my mind is no longer my own.
It's the situation... the stress...
What?
That! Now stop it! Anakin!!
May I tell you something?
I don't know.
Then how can I tell you?
Maybe you should use your Jedi intuition.
It doesn't work around you. My mind is always a muddle... I can only think of you.
Anakin, don't...
From the moment I met you, all those years ago, a day hasn't gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm close to you again, I'm in agony. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you mskes my stomach turn over - my mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I can't breathe. I'm haunted by the kiss you should never have given me. My heart is beating, hoping that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul, tormenting me. What can I do? I will do anything you ask... If you are suffering as much as I am, tell me.
...I can't. We can't. It's just not possible.
Anything's possible. Padme, please listen...
You listen. We live in a real world. Come back to it. You're studying to become a Jedi Knight. I'm a Senator. If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion, they will take us to a place we cannot go... regardless of the way we feel about each other.
Then you do feel something! There's an extraordinary connection between us. You can't deny that.
Annie, it doesn't make any difference. Jedi aren't allowed to marry. You swore an oath, remember? You'd be expelled from the Order. I will not let you give up your responsibilities... your future, for me.
I was destined to be a Jedi. I don't think I could be anything else. But you are asking me to be rational. That is something I know I cannot do. I wish I could wish my feelings away... but I can't.
I am not going to give into this. I'm not going to throw my life away. I have more important things to do than fall in love.
It wouldn't have to be that way... we could keep it a secret.
Then we'd be living a lie - one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to. Mt sister saw it. So did my mother. I couldn't do that. Could you, Anakin? Could you live like that?
Sure you do... you just don't want to tell me.
Are you going to use one of your Jedi mind tricks on me?
They only work on the weak-minded. You are anything but weak-minded.
All right... his name was Palo. I was twelve. We were both in the Legislative Youth Program. He was a few years older then I... very cute... dark curly hair... dreamy eyes.
All right, I get the picture... whatever happened to him?
I went on to become a Queen. He went on to become an artist.
Maybe he was the smart one.
You really don't like politicians, do you?
I like two or three, but I'm not really sure about one of them. I don't think the system works.
How would you have it work?
We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problems, agree what's in the best interests of all the people, and then do it.
That is exactly what we do. The trouble is that people don't wlways agree. In fact, they hardly ever do.
Then they should be made to.
By whom? Who's going to make them?
I don't know. Someone.
You?
Of course not me.
But someone.
Someone wise.
That sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.
Well, if it works...
You're making fun of me.
On no, I'd be much too frightened to tease a Senator.
You're so bad!
Your presence is soothing.
You had a nightmare again last night.
Jedi don't have nightmares.
I heard you.
I saw my mother. I saw her as clearly as I see you now. She's suffering, Padme. She is in pain...They're killing her! I know I'm disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator. I know I will be punished and possibly thrown out of the Jedi Order, but I must go. I have to help her! I'm sorry, Padme. I don't have a choice.
Annie, I told you I wouldn't let you give up your future for me. I'll go with you. That way you can continue to protect me, and you won't be disobeying your mandate.
What about Master Obi-wan?
I guess we won't tell him, will we?
Oh, my... oh, my! Master Anakin! My goodness, I can hardly believe it! And this must be Miss Padme.
Hello, Threepio.
Oh, dear! I'm so terribly sorry, Master Annie.
Threepio, what's happened?
Hello.
I'm Padme.
To find my mother.
No, Annie!
Take my speeder bike.
Anakin...
Please don't leave us, Miss Padme. These people need your help.
I'm not leaving, Threepio. I just can't sleep.
That's something I cannot relate to. As a Protocol Droid, I'm either active or inactive. There's no in-between.
I guess you're lucky.
Do you really think so..? I suppose I shouldn't expect...
You're not happy here?
Oh, I'm not unhappy... and my masters here ar so kind I wouldn't wish to trouuble them, it's just... being like this... well, it's embarrassing.
Being like what?
Naked. If you pardon the expression. You see, when Master Annie made me, he never quite found the time to give me any outer covering. It's so humiliating. How would you like it if you had to go around with all your circuits showing?
I guess I wouldn't like it at all.
Of course you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's simply not protocol.
Maybe we can do something about it.
I don't think so. Only Master Annie...
Why not? They seem to have a box of old coverings here.
Oh? How observant of you, Miss Padme. Of course, I'm just not mechanically minded... if you see what I mean.
Let's see, if we put this... here...
Ooooh! That's tickles.
You'll have to be quiet, Threepio. Hold still, please.
I'm going after him!
I thought the first thing he said was to retransmit his message to Coruscant.
Understood, Master.
They'll never get there in time to save him. They have to come half way across the galaxy. Look, Geonosis is less than a parsec away.
If he's still alive.
Annie, are you just going to sit here and let him die?? He's your friend... your mentor...
...He's like my father, but you heard Master Windu. He gave me strict orders to stay here.
He gave you strict orders to protect me... ...and I'm going to save Obi-Wan. So if you plan to protect me, you will have to come along.
Hey, where are you going?
To find Obi-Wan.
No! You're not!
Let go of me!
I'm not letting you go out there. It's too dangerous.
What?!?
It's my job to protect you. I said it's too dangerous. You're not going, and that's final!
Don't you give me orders, Annie! I'm a Senator of the Galactic Republic. You have no authority to contain me, restrain me, or direct me! You remember your place, young man. Now you can come along and protect me or stay here. It's up to you.
Senator Amidala, I've heard so much about you.
Count Dooku, I assume.
I'm delighted to meet you at last. We have a great deal to discuss, Senator. I hope you can keep your young Jedi under control.
Don't worry he's housebroken.
He has been convicted of espionage, Senator, and will be executed. In just a few hours, I believe.
He is an officer of the Republic. You can't do that.
We don't recognise the Republic here, Senator. But if Naboo were to join our Alliance, I could easily hear your plea for clemency.
And if I don't join your rebellion, I assume this Jedi with me will also die?
I don't wish to make you to join our cause against your will, Senator, but you are a rational, honest representative of your people and I assume you want to do what's in their best interest. Aren't you fed up with the corruption, the bureaucrats, the hypocrisy of it all?.. Aren't you? Be honest, Senator.
The ideals are still alive, Count, even if the institution is failing.
You believe in the same ideals we believe in! The same ideals we are striving to make prominent.
If what you say is true, you should stay in the Republic and help Chancellor Palpatine put things right.
The Chancellor means well, M'Lady but he is incompetent. He has promised to cut the bureaucracy, but the bureaucrats are stronger than ever, no? Senator, the Republic cannot be fixed. It is time to start over. The democratic process in the Republic is a sham, a shell game played on the voters. It will not be long before the cult of greed, called the Republic, will lose even the pretext of democracy and freedom.
I cannot believe that. I will not forsake all I have honoured and worked for and betray the Republic. I know of your treaties with the Trade Federation, the Commerce Guilds, and the others, Count. What is happening here is not government that has been bought out by business... it's business becoming government!
Are you willing to betray your Jedi friends? Without your co-operation I can do nothing to stop their execution.
What is to happen to me? Am I to be executed also?
You may cause a lot of bloodshed, my young Jedi, but you will not escape.
Anakin...
Do you have anything to say before your sentence is carried out?
You are committing an act of war, Archduke. I hope you are prepared for the consequences.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not afraid to die. I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.
What are you talking about?
I love you.
You love me?! I thought we decided not to fall in love. That we would be forced to live a lie. That it would destroy our lives...
I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway. My love for you is a puzzle, Annie, for which I have no answers. I can't control it... and now I don't care. I truly, deeply love you, and before we die I want you to know.
You okay?
Sure! Well, sort of.
Then, I'm sorry, old friend. You will have to be destroyed.
Look!
...Not yet...
Anakin!
