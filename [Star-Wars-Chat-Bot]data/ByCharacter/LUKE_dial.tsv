LUKE	Hurry up!  Come with me!  What are you waiting for?!  Get in gear!
===	===
FIXER	Did I hear a young noise blast through here?
CAMIE	It was just Wormie on another rampage.
LUKE	Shape it up you guys!...  Biggs? I didn't know you were back! When did you get in?
BIGGS	Just now.  I wanted to surprise you, hot shot.  I thought you'd be here... certainly didn't expect you to be out working.
LUKE	The Academy didn't change you much... but you're back so soon? Hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission?
BIGGS	Of course I got it.  Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last week. First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service... ... I just came back to say goodbye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons.
LUKE	I almost forgot.  There's a battle going on!  Right here in our system. Come and look!
DEAK	Not again!  Forget it.
===	===
LUKE	There they are!
BIGGS	That's no battle, hot shot... they're just sitting there!  Probably a freighter-tanker refueling.
LUKE	But there was a lot of firing earlier... Hey, easy with those...
CAMIE	Don't worry about it, Wormie.
FIXER	I keep telling you, the Rebellion is a long way from here.  I doubt if the Empire would even fight to keep this system.  Believe me Luke, this planet is a big hunk of nothing...
===	===
LUKE	... so I cut off my power, shut down the afterburners and came in low on Deak's trail.  I was so close I thought I was going to fry my instruments. As it was I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad.  Uncle Owen was pretty upset.  He grounded me for the rest of the season.  You should have been there... it was fantastic.
BIGGS	You ought to take it a little easy Luke.  You may be the hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous.  Keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall.
LUKE	Look who's talking.  Now that you've been around those giant starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle. You've gotten soft in the city...
BIGGS	I've missed you kid.
LUKE	Well, things haven't been the same since you left, Biggs.  It's been so...quiet.
BIGGS	Luke, I didn't come back just to say goodbye...  I shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust... and if I don't come back, I want somebody to know.
LUKE	What are you talking about?
BIGGS	I made some friends at the Academy. ... when our frigate goes to one of the central systems, we're going to jump ship and join the Alliance...
LUKE	Join the Rebellion?!  Are you kidding!  How?
BIGGS	Quiet down will ya!  You got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater!
LUKE	I'm sorry.  I'm quiet. Listen how quiet I am.  You can barely hear me...
BIGGS	My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact.
LUKE	YouÕre crazy!  You could wander around forever trying to find them.
BIGGS	I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them I'll do what I can on my own...  It's what we always talked about.  Luke, I'm not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service.  The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side - the side I believe in.
LUKE	And I'm stuck here...
BIGGS	I thought you were going to the Academy next term.  You'll get your chance to get off this rock.
LUKE	Not likely!  I had to cancel my application.  There has been a lot of unrest among the Sand People since you left... they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead.
BIGGS	Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sand People with one blaster.
LUKE	I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off.  He needs me for just one more season. I can't leave him now.
BIGGS	I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important. What good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire?...  You know they're starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems... it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the Empire.
LUKE	It couldn't happen here.  You said it yourself.  The Empire won't bother with this rock.
BIGGS	Things always change.
LUKE	I wish I was going...  Are you going to be around long?
BIGGS	No, I'm leaving in the morning...
LUKE	Then I guess I won't see you.
BIGGS	Maybe someday...  I'll keep a lookout.
LUKE	Well, I'll be at the Academy next season... after that who knows.  I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that's for sure...  Take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend I've got.
BIGGS	So long, Luke.
===	===
BERU	Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.
LUKE	It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him.
OWEN	I have no need for a protocol droid.
C-3PO	Sir - not in an environment such as this - that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...
OWEN	What I really need is a droid that understands the binary languages of moisture vaporators.
C-3PO	Vaporators!  Sir - My first job was programming binary load lifters ... very similar to your vaporators. You could say...
OWEN	Do you speak Bocce?
C-3PO	Of course I can, sir.  It's like a second language for me...  I'm as fluent in Bocce...
OWEN	All right; shut up! I'll take this one.
C-3PO	Shutting up, sir.
OWEN	Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you?  I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner.
LUKE	But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters...
OWEN	You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done.  Now, come on, get to it!
LUKE	All right, come on!  And the red one, come on.  Well, come on, Red, let's go. Uncle Owen...
OWEN	Yeah?
LUKE	This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look!
OWEN	Hey, what're you trying to push on us?
C-3PO	Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition.  A real bargain.
LUKE	Uncle Owen...
OWEN	Yeah?
LUKE	What about that one?
OWEN	What about that blue one?  We'll take that one.
LUKE	Yeah, take it away.
C-3PO	Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir.  He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before.  Here he comes.
LUKE	Okay, let's go.
C-3PO	Now, don't forget this!  Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity!
===	===
C-3PO	Thank the maker!  This oil bath is going to feel so good.  I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!
LUKE	It just isn't fair.  Oh, Biggs is right.  I'm never gonna get out of here!
C-3PO	Is there anything I might do to help?
LUKE	Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!
C-3PO	I don't think so, sir.  I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.  Not on this planet, anyways.  As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.
LUKE	Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.
C-3PO	I see, sir.
LUKE	Uh, you can call me Luke.
C-3PO	I see, sir Luke.
LUKE	Just Luke.
C-3PO	And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.
LUKE	Hello. You got a lot of carbon scoring here.  It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.
C-3PO	With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.
LUKE	You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?
C-3PO	That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.
LUKE	Have you been in many battles?
C-3PO	Several, I think.  Actually, there's not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.
LUKE	Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good.  Were you on a starcruiser or...
LEIA	Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.
LUKE	What's this?
C-3PO	What is what?!?  He asked you a question... What is that?
LEIA	Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.
C-3PO	Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction.  Old data. Pay it no mind.
LUKE	Who is she?  She's beautiful.
C-3PO	I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
LEIA	Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...
C-3PO	I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.  A person of some importance, sir - I believe.  Our captain was attached to...
LUKE	Is there more to this recording?
C-3PO	Behave yourself, Artoo.  You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him.  He's our new master. He says he's the property of Obi- Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts.  And it's a private message for him.  Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what he's talking about.  Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.
LUKE	Obi-Wan Kenobi?  I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?
C-3PO	I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?
LUKE	Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea.  He's kind of a strange old hermit. I wonder who she is.  It sounds like she's in trouble.  I'd better play back the whole thing.
C-3PO	He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system.  He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.
LUKE	H'm?  Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off!  Okay. There you go. Well, wait a minute.  Where'd she go?  Bring her back!  Play back the entire message.
C-3PO	What message?  The one youÕve just been playing.  The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards!
AUNT BERU	Luke?  Luke!  Come to dinner!
LUKE	All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.
C-3PO	I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.
LUKE	Well, see what you can do with him.  I'll be right back.
C-3PO	Just you reconsider playing that message for him. No, I don't think he likes you at all. No, I don't like you either.
===	===
LUKE	You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.
OWEN	What makes you think that?
LUKE	Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him.  He says he belongs to someone called Obi- Wan Kenobi. I thought he might have meant Ben. Do you know what he's talking about?  Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben.
OWEN	That old man's just a crazy wizard.  Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That'll be the end of it.  It belongs to us now.
LUKE	But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?
OWEN	He won't, I don't think he exists any more.  He died about the same time as your father.
LUKE	He knew my father?
OWEN	I told you to forget it.  Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow.  In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.
LUKE	Yes, sir.  I think those new droids are going to work out fine.  In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season.  And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.
OWEN	You mean the next semester before harvest?
LUKE	Sure, there're more than enough droids.
OWEN	Harvest is when I need you the most.  Only one more season. This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands.  And then you can go to the Academy next year. You must understand I need you here, Luke.
LUKE	But it's a whole 'nother year.
OWEN	Look, it's only one more season.
LUKE	Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.
AUNT BERU	Where are you going?
LUKE	It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those droids.
AUNT BERU	Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him.
OWEN	I'll make it up to him next year. I promise.
AUNT BERU	Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him.
OWEN	That's what I'm afraid of.
===	===
LUKE	What are you doing hiding there?
C-3PO	It wasn't my fault, sir.  Please don't deactivate me.  I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.
LUKE	Oh, no!
===	===
C-3PO	That R2 unit has always been a problem.  These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand.  Even I can't understand their logic at times.
LUKE	How could I be so stupid?  He's nowhere in sight.  Blast it!
C-3PO	Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?
LUKE	It's too dangerous with all the Sand People around.  We'll have to wait until morning.
OWEN	Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night.
LUKE	All right, I'll be there in a few minutes.  Boy, am I gonna get it. You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.
C-3PO	Oh, he excels at that, sir.
===	===
LUKE	How's that. Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far.  We must have missed him.  Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well.
C-3PO	Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault.
LUKE	Sure.  He needs you.  He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...
C-3PO	Deactivate!  Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt...
LUKE	Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner.  It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator.
===	===
LUKE	Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?
C-3PO	Master Luke here is your rightful owner.  We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me of your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.
LUKE	Well, come on. It's getting late. I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up.
C-3PO	If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop.
LUKE	No, he's not going to try anything. What's wrong with him now?
C-3PO	Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.
LUKE	Sand People!  Or worse!  Come on, let's have a look.  Come on.
===	===
LUKE	There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any... wait a second, they're Sand People all right.  I can see one of them now.
===	===
OBI-WAN	Hello there!  Come here my little friend.  Don't be afraid. Don't worry, he'll be all right.
LUKE	What happened?
OBI-WAN	Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day.  You're fortunate you're still in one piece.
LUKE	Ben?  Ben Kenobi!  Boy, am I glad to see you!
OBI-WAN	The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly.  Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far?
LUKE	Oh, this little droid!  I think he's searching for his former master ...  I've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems to be no stopping him.  He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about?
OBI-WAN	Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan?  Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time.
LUKE	I think my uncle knew him.  He said he was dead.
OBI-WAN	Oh, he's not dead, no... not yet.
LUKE	You know him!
OBI-WAN	Well of course, of course I know him.  He's me!  I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.
LUKE	Then the droid does belong to you.
OBI-WAN	Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid.  Very interesting... I think we better get indoors. The Sand People are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.
LUKE	... Threepio!
===	===
C-3PO	Where am I?  I must have taken a bad step...
LUKE	Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before the Sand People return.
C-3PO	I don't think I can make it.  You go on, Master Luke.  There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
LUKE	No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that?
OBI-WAN	Quickly, son... they're on the move.
===	===
LUKE	No, my father didn't fight in the wars.  He was a navigator on a spice freighter.
OBI-WAN	That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals.  Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.
LUKE	You fought in the Clone Wars?
OBI-WAN	Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.
LUKE	I wish I'd known him.
OBI-WAN	He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.  And he was a good friend.  Which reminds me... I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.
C-3PO	Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile.
LUKE	Sure, go ahead. What is it?
OBI-WAN	Your fathers lightsaber.  This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster. An elegant weapon for a more civilized time.  For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.  Before the dark times, before the Empire.
LUKE	How did my father die?
OBI-WAN	A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.  He betrayed and murdered your father.  Now the Jedi are all but extinct.  Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.
LUKE	The Force?
OBI-WAN	Well, the Force is what gives the Jedi his power.  It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend.  And where you come from.
LUKE	I saw part of the message he was...
OBI-WAN	I seem to have found it.
LEIA	General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.  Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.  I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.  I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit.  My father will know how to retrieve it.  You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.  This is our most desperate hour.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.
OBI-WAN	You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.
LUKE	Alderaan?  I'm not going to Alderaan.  I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.
OBI-WAN	I need your help, Luke.  I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. She needs your help.
LUKE	I can't get involved!  I've got work to do!  It's not that I like the Empire.  I hate it!  But there's nothing I can do about it right now.  It's such a long way from here.
OBI-WAN	That's your uncle talking.
LUKE	Oh, God, my uncle.  How am I ever going to explain this?
OBI-WAN	Learn about the Force, Luke.
LUKE	Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.  You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
OBI-WAN	You must do what you feel is right, of course.
===	===
LUKE	It looks like Sand People did this, all right.  Look, here are gaffi sticks, bantha tracks.  It's just... I never heard of them hitting anything this big before.
OBI-WAN	They didn't.  But we are meant to think they did.  These tracks are side by side.  Sand People always ride single file to hide there numbers.
LUKE	These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.
OBI-WAN	And these blast points, too accurate for Sand People.  Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
LUKE	Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas? If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to.  And that would lead them back home!
OBI-WAN	Wait, Luke!  It's too dangerous.
===	===
LUKE	Uncle Owen!  Aunt Beru!  Uncle Owen!
===	===
OBI-WAN	There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire.
LUKE	I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing here for me now.  I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.
===	===
TROOPER	How long have you had these droids?
LUKE	About three or four seasons.
OBI-WAN	They're for sale if you want them.
TROOPER	Let me see your identification.
OBI-WAN	You don't need to see his identification.
TROOPER	We don't need to see his identification.
OBI-WAN	These are not the droids youÕre looking for.
TROOPER	These are not the droids we're looking for.
OBI-WAN	He can go about his business.
TROOPER	You can go about your business.
OBI-WAN	Move along.
TROOPER	Move along.  Move along.
===	===
C-3PO	I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures.
LUKE	Go on, go on.  I can't understand how we got by those troopers.  I thought we were dead.
OBI-WAN	The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.  You will find it a powerful ally.
LUKE	Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?
OBI-WAN	Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here.  Only watch your step.  This place can be a little rough.
LUKE	I'm ready for anything.
C-3PO	Come along, Artoo.
===	===
BARTENDER	We don't serve their kind here!
LUKE	What?
BARTENDER	Your droids. They'll have to wait outside.  We don't want them here.
LUKE	Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder.  We don't want any trouble.
C-3PO	I heartily agree with you sir.
CREATURE	Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?
HUMAN	He doesn't like you.
LUKE	I'm sorry.
HUMAN	I don't like you either Don't insult us.  You just watch yourself.  We're wanted men.  I have the death sentence on twelve systems.
LUKE	I'll be careful than.
HUMAN	You'll be dead.
OBI-WAN	This little one isn't worth the effort.  Come let me buy you something...
BARTENDER	No blasters!  No blaster!
OBI-WAN	This is Chewbacca.  He's first- mate on a ship that might suit our needs.
===	===
HAN	Han Solo.  I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.  Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.
OBI-WAN	Yes, indeed.  If it's a fast ship.
HAN	Fast ship?  You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?
OBI-WAN	Should I have?
HAN	It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs! I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.  I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.  She's fast enough for you, old man.  What's the cargo?
OBI-WAN	Only passengers.  Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked.
HAN	What is it?  Some kind of local trouble?
OBI-WAN	Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.
HAN	Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?  And it's going to cost you something extra.  Ten thousand in advance.
LUKE	Ten thousand?  We could almost buy our own ship for that!
HAN	But who's going to fly it, kid! You?
LUKE	You bet I could.  I'm not such a bad pilot myself!  We don't have to sit here and listen...
OBI-WAN	We haven't that much with us. But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.
HAN	Seventeen, huh! Okay.  You guys got yourself a ship.  We'll leave as soon as you're ready.  Docking bay Ninety-four.
OBI-WAN	Ninety-four.
HAN	Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.
TROOPER	All right, we'll check it out.
HAN	Seventeen thousand!  Those guys must really be desperate.  This could really save my neck.  Get back to the ship and get her ready.
===	===
OBI-WAN	You'll have to sell your speeder.
LUKE	That's okay.  I'm never coming back to this planet again.
===	===
LUKE	He says it's the best he can do. Since the XP-38 came out, they just arenÕt in demand.
OBI-WAN	It will be enough. If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.
===	===
LUKE	What a piece of junk.
HAN	She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.  She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.  I've added some special modifications myself. We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here.
===	===
HAN	Stay sharp!  There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off.
LUKE	Why don't you outrun them?  I thought you said this thing was fast.
HAN	Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home.  We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!
===	===
HAN	Here's where the fun begins!
OBI-WAN	How long before you can make the jump to light speed?
HAN	It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi- computer.
LUKE	Are you kidding?  At the rate they're gaining...
HAN	Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!  Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?
LUKE	What's that flashing?
HAN	We're losing our deflector shield. Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed.
===	===
LUKE	Are you all right?  What's wrong?
OBI-WAN	I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.  I fear something terrible has happened. You'd better get on with your exercises.
HAN	Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.  I told you I'd outrun 'em. Don't everyone thank me at once. Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.
C-3PO	Now be careful, Artoo. He made a fair move.  Screaming about it won't help you.
HAN	Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
C-3PO	But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.
HAN	That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose.  Wookiees are known to do that.
C-3PO	I see your point, sir.  I suggest a new strategy, Artoo.  Let the Wookiee win.
OBI-WAN	Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.
LUKE	You mean it controls your actions?
OBI-WAN	Partially. But it also obeys your commands.
HAN	Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.
LUKE	You don't believe in the Force, do you?
HAN	Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.  I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
OBI-WAN	I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.
LUKE	With the blast shield down, I can't even see.  How am I supposed to fight?
OBI-WAN	Your eyes can deceive you.  Don't trust them. Stretch out with your feelings. You see, you can do it.
HAN	I call it luck.
OBI-WAN	In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.
HAN	Look, going good against remotes is one thing.  Going good against the living?  That's something else. Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.
LUKE	You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote.
OBI-WAN	That's good.  You have taken your first step into a larger world.
===	===
HAN	Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in the sublight engines. What the...?  Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts.
LUKE	What's going on?
HAN	Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!
LUKE	What do you mean?  Where is it?
HAN	Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid.  It ain't there.  It's been totally blown away.
LUKE	What?  How?
OBI-WAN	Destroyed... by the Empire!
HAN	The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.  It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've... There's another ship coming in.
LUKE	Maybe they know what happened.
OBI-WAN	It's an Imperial fighter.
LUKE	It followed us!
OBI-WAN	No.  It's a short range fighter.
HAN	There aren't any bases around here.  Where did it come from?
===	===
LUKE	It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in big trouble.
HAN	Not if I can help it.  Chewie... jam it's transmissions.
OBI-WAN	It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range.
HAN	Not for long...
===	===
OBI-WAN	A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.
LUKE	Then he must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something...
HAN	Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.
===	===
LUKE	Look at him.  He's heading for that small moon.
HAN	I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.
OBI-WAN	That's no moon!  It's a space station.
HAN	It's too big to be a space station.
LUKE	I have a very bad feeling about this.
OBI-WAN	Turn the ship around!
HAN	Yeah, I think your right.  Full reverse!  Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
LUKE	Why are we still moving towards it?
HAN	We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in!
LUKE	But there's gotta be something you can do!
HAN	There's nothin' I can do about it, kid.  I'm in full power.  I'm going to have to shut down.  But they're not going to get me without a fight!
OBI-WAN	You can't win.  But there are alternatives to fighting.
===	===
LUKE	Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.
HAN	I use them for smuggling.  I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them.  This is ridiculous.  Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam.
OBI-WAN	Leave that to me!
HAN	Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!
OBI-WAN	Who's the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him?
===	===
GANTRY OFFICER	TX-four-one-two.  Why aren't you at your post?  TX-four-one-two, do you copy? Take over.  We've got a bad transmitter.  I'll see what I can do.
LUKE	You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.
HAN	Bring them on!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
C-3PO	We found the computer outlet, sir.
OBI-WAN	Plug in.  He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.
C-3PO	He says he's found the main control to the power beam that's holding the ship here.  He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor. The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.
OBI-WAN	I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone.
HAN	Whatever you say.  I've done more than I bargained for on this trip already.
LUKE	I want to go with you.
OBI-WAN	Be patient, Luke.  Stay and watch over the droids.
LUKE	But he can...
OBI-WAN	They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.  Your destiny lies along a different path from mine.  The Force will be with you ... always!
HAN	Boy you said it, Chewie. Where did you dig up that old fossil?
LUKE	Ben is a great man.
HAN	Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.
LUKE	I didn't hear you give any ideas...
HAN	Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for them to pick us up...
LUKE	Who do you think... What is it?
C-3PO	"I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says ""I found her,"" and keeps repeating, ""She's here."""
LUKE	Well, who... who has he found?
C-3PO	Princess Leia.
LUKE	The princess?  She's here?
HAN	Princess?
LUKE	Where... where is she?
HAN	Princess?  What's going on?
C-3PO	Level five. Detention block AA- twenty-three.  I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.
LUKE	Oh, no!  We've got to do something.
HAN	What are you talking about?
LUKE	The droid belongs to her.  She's the one in the message.  We've got to help her.
HAN	Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.  The old man wants us to wait right here.
LUKE	But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?
HAN	I'm not going anywhere.
LUKE	They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured.  Now all you want to do is stay.
HAN	Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.
LUKE	But they're going to kill her!
HAN	Better her than me...
LUKE	She's rich.
HAN	Rich?
LUKE	Yes.  Rich, powerful!  Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...
HAN	What?
LUKE	Well more wealth that you can imagine.
HAN	I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!
LUKE	You'll get it!
HAN	I better!
LUKE	You will...
HAN	All right, kid.  But you'd better be right about this!
LUKE	All right.
HAN	What's your plan?
LUKE	Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders there will you? Okay.  Now, I'm going to put these on you. Okay.  Han, you put these on.
HAN	Don't worry, Chewie.  I think I know what he has in mind.
C-3PO	Master Luke, sir!  Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?
LUKE	Lock the door!
HAN	And hope they don't have blasters.
C-3PO	That isn't very reassuring.
===	===
LUKE	I can't see a thing in this helmet.
===	===
HAN	This is not going to work.
LUKE	Why didn't you say so before?
HAN	I did say so before!
===	===
OFFICER	Where are you taking this... thing?
LUKE	Prisoner transfer from Block one- one-three-eight.
OFFICER	I wasn't notified.  I'll have to clear it.
HAN	Look out!  He's loose!
LUKE	He's going to pull us all apart.
HAN	Go get him! We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in. Here it is... cell twenty-one- eight-seven.  You go get her.  I'll hold them here. Everything is under control. Situation normal.
INTERCOM VOICE	What happened?
HAN	Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction.  But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now.  We're fine.  We're all fine here, now, thank you.  How are you?
INTERCOM VOICE	We're sending a squad up.
HAN	Uh, uh, negative, negative.  We had a reactor leak here now.  Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak... very dangerous.
INTERCOM VOICE	Who is this?  What's your operating number?
HAN	Boring conversation anyway. Luke!  We're going to have company!
===	===
LEIA	Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?
LUKE	What?  Oh... the uniform.  I'm Luke Skywalker.  I'm here to rescue you.
LEIA	You're who?
LUKE	I'm here to rescue you.  I've got your R2 unit.  I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
LEIA	Ben Kenobi is here!  Where is he?
LUKE	Come on!
===	===
HAN	Chewie! Get behind me!  Get behind me! Can't get out that way.
LEIA	Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.
HAN	Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness.
LUKE	See-Threepio!  See-Threepio!
C-3PO	Yes sir?
LUKE	We've been cut off!  Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?... What was that?  I didn't copy!
===	===
LUKE	There isn't any other way out.
HAN	I can't hold them off forever! Now what?
LEIA	This is some rescue.  When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?
HAN	He's the brains, sweetheart.
LUKE	Well, I didn't...
HAN	What the hell are you doing?
LEIA	Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise guy.
HAN	Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell!  Get in there and don't worry about it. Wonderful girl!  Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.  Get in there!
===	===
HAN	Oh!  The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea.  What an incredible smell you've discovered!  Let's get out of here!  Get away from there...
LUKE	No!  wait! Will you forget it?  I already tried it.  It's magnetically sealed!
LEIA	Put that thing away!  You're going to get us all killed.
HAN	Absolutely, Your Worship.  Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here.  You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.
LEIA	It could be worse...
HAN	It's worse.
LUKE	There's something alive in here!
HAN	That's your imagination.
LUKE	Something just moves past my leg! Look!  Did you see that?
HAN	What?
LUKE	Help!
HAN	Luke!  Luke!  Luke!
LEIA	Luke! Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.
LUKE	Blast it, will you!  My gun's jammed.
HAN	Where?
LUKE	Anywhere!  Oh!!
HAN	Luke!  Luke!
LEIA	Grab him! What happened?
LUKE	I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared...
HAN	I've got a very bad feeling about this.
LUKE	The walls are moving!
LEIA	Don't just stand there.  Try and brace it with something.
LUKE	Wait a minute! Threepio!  Come in Threepio! Threepio!  Where could he be?
===	===
LUKE	Threepio!  Come in, Threepio! Threepio!
HAN	Get to the top!
LEIA	I can't
LUKE	Where could he be?  Threepio! Threepio, will you come in?
===	===
LUKE	Threepio!
===	===
C-3PO	We've had some problems...
LUKE	Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level, will you? Do you copy?
===	===
LUKE	Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.
===	===
LUKE	Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.
C-3PO	No.  Shut them all down!  Hurry! Listen to them!  They're dying, Artoo!  Curse my metal body!  I wasn't fast enough.  It's all my fault!  My poor master!
LUKE	Threepio, we're all right!
===	===
LUKE	We're all right.  You did great. Hey... hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number ... where are we?
===	===
HAN	If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here.
LUKE	Well, let's get moving!
HAN	Where are you going?
LEIA	No, wait.  They'll hear!
HAN	Come here, you big coward! Chewie!  Come here!
LEIA	Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you.  Okay?
HAN	Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight!  I take orders from one person!  Me!
LEIA	It's a wonder you're still alive. Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?
HAN	No reward is worth this.
===	===
HAN	There she is.
LUKE	See-Threepio, do you copy?
C-3PO	For the moment.  Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship.
LUKE	We're right above you.  Stand by.
LEIA	You came in that thing?  You're braver that I thought.
HAN	Nice!  Come on!
FIRST TROOPER	It's them!  Blast them!
HAN	Get back to the ship!
LUKE	Where are you going?  Come back!
LEIA	He certainly has courage.
LUKE	What good will it do us if he gets himself killed?  Come on!
===	===
LUKE	I think we took a wrong turn.
LEIA	There's no lock!
LUKE	That oughta hold it for a while.
LEIA	Quick, we've got to get across. Find the control that extends the bridge.
LUKE	Oh, I think I just blasted it.
LEIA	They're coming through!
LUKE	Here, hold this.
LEIA	Here they come! For luck!
===	===
HAN	Didn't we just leave this party? What kept you?
LEIA	We ran into some old friends.
LUKE	Is the ship all right?
HAN	Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission.
===	===
LUKE	Look!
===	===
HAN	Now's our chance!  Go!
LUKE	No!
HAN	Come on!
LEIA	Come on!  Luke, its too late!
HAN	Blast the door!  Kid!
OBI-WAN	Run, Luke!  Run!
===	===
LUKE	I can't believe he's gone.
LEIA	There wasn't anything you could have done.
HAN	Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet!
===	===
LUKE	They're coming in too fast!
===	===
LUKE	Got him!  I got him!
HAN	Great kid!  Don't get cocky.
===	===
LUKE	That's it!  We did it!
LEIA	We did it!
===	===
HAN	Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I even amaze myself.
LEIA	That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, they let us go.  It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.
HAN	Easy... you call that easy?
LEIA	Their tracking us!
HAN	Not this ship, sister.
LEIA	At least the information in Artoo is still intact.
HAN	What's so important?  What's he carrying?
LEIA	The technical readouts of that battle station.  I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found.  It's not over yet!
HAN	It is for me, sister!  Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess.  I expect to be well paid.  I'm in it for the money!
LEIA	You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive! Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anyone.
LUKE	I care! So... what do you think of her, Han?
HAN	I'm trying not to, kid!
LUKE	Good...
HAN	Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me...
LUKE	No!
===	===
DODONNA	The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet. Its defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault.  A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.
GOLD LEADER	Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?
DODONNA	Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense.  An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station. The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point.  The target area is only two meters wide.  It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port.  The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.  A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station. Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.  The shaft is ray- shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.
WEDGE	That's impossible, even for a computer.
LUKE	It's not impossible.  I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home.  They're not much bigger than two meters.
DODONNA	Man your ships!  And may the Force be with you!
===	===
MAN	All flight troops, man your stations. All flight troops, man your stations.
LUKE	So... you got your reward and you're just leaving then?
HAN	That's right, yeah!  I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff.  Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you?  Why don't you come with us?  You're pretty good in a fight.  I could use you.
LUKE	Come on!  Why don't you take a look around?  You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.
HAN	What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?  Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage.  It's more like suicide.
LUKE	All right.  Well, take care of yourself, Han... guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?
HAN	Hey, Luke... may the Force be with you! What're you lookin' at?  I know what I'm doing.
===	===
LEIA	What's wrong?
LUKE	Oh, it's Han!  I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind.
LEIA	He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him.
LUKE	I only wish Ben were here.
BIGGS	Luke!  I don't believe it!  How'd you get here... are you going out with us?!
LUKE	Biggs!  Of course, I'll be up there with you!  Listen, have I got some stories to tell...
RED LEADER	Are you... Luke Skywalker?  Have you been checked out on the Incom T-sixty-five?
BIGGS	Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories.
RED LEADER	I met your father once when I was just a boy.  He was a great pilot. You'll do all right.  If you've got half of your father's skill, you'll do better than all right.
LUKE	Thank you, sir.  I'll try.
BIGGS	I've got to get aboard.  Listen, you'll tell me your stories when we come back.  All right?
LUKE	I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.
BIGGS	You did, all right.  It's going to be like old times Luke. We're a couple of shooting stars that'll never be stopped!
CHIEF	This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up.  Do you want a new one?
LUKE	Not on your life!  That little droid and I have been through a lot together. You okay, Artoo?
CHIEF	Okay, easy she goes!
C-3PO	Hang on tight, Artoo, you've got to come back. You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?
OBI-WAN	Luke, the Force will be with you.
===	===
RED ELEVEN	Red Eleven standing by.
LUKE	Red Five standing by.
===	===
LUKE	This is Red Five!  I'm going in!
===	===
LUKE	I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.
===	===
LUKE	I'm on my way in now...
RED LEADER	Watch yourself!  There's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower.
LUKE	I'm on it.
===	===
LUKE	My scope's negative.  I don't see anything.
===	===
LUKE	Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in.
===	===
LUKE	Got him!
===	===
LUKE	I'm hit, but not bad.
===	===
LUKE	Artoo, see what you can do with it.  Hang on back there.
===	===
LUKE	I can't shake him!
===	===
LUKE	Blast it!  Wedge where are you?
===	===
LUKE	Thanks, Wedge.
===	===
LUKE	No sign of any... wait!
===	===
LUKE	Coming in point three five.
RED TEN	I see them.
===	===
LUKE	Red Leader, we're right above you.  Turn to point...
===	===
LUKE	... oh-five; we'll cover for you.
RED LEADER	Stay there...
===	===
LUKE	Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up. We're going in.  We're going in full throttle.
===	===
LUKE	It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home.
===	===
LUKE	Watch yourself!  Increase speed full throttle!
===	===
LUKE	You worry about those fighters! I'll worry about the tower!
===	===
LUKE	Artoo... that, that stabilizer's broken loose again!  See if you can't lock it down!
===	===
WEDGE	I'm hit!  I can't stay with you.
LUKE	Get clear, Wedge.
===	===
LUKE	You can't do any more good back there!
===	===
LUKE	Artoo, try and increase the power!
===	===
BASE VOICE	His computer's off.  Luke, you switched off your targeting computer.  What's wrong?
LUKE	Nothing.  I'm all right.
===	===
LUKE	I've lost Artoo!
===	===
LEIA	Luke!  Luke!  Luke!
HAN	Hey!  Hey!
LUKE	I knew you'd come back!  I just knew it!
HAN	Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the reward.
LEIA	Hey, I knew there was more to you than money.
LUKE	Oh, no!
C-3PO	Oh, my!  Artoo!  Can you hear me? Say something! You can repair him, can't you?
TECHNICIAN	We'll get to work on him right away.
C-3PO	You must repair him!  Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them.
LUKE	He'll be all right.
===	===
C-3PO	Good morning.
JABBA	Bo Shuda!
C-3PO	The message, Artoo, the message.
LUKE	Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. (Jabba's crowd laughs) With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids.
C-3PO	What did he say?
LUKE	... Both are hardworking and will serve you well.
C-3PO	This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message.
JABBA	There will be no bargain.
C-3PO	We're doomed.
JABBA	I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he is.
C-3PO	Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite.
===	===
LUKE	I must speak with Jabba. You will take me to Jabba now! You serve your master well. And you will be rewarded.
===	===
C-3PO	At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.
BIB	Master. ...Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight.
JABBA	I told you not to admit him.
LUKE	I must be allowed to speak.
BIB	He must be allowed to speak.
JABBA	You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick.
LUKE	You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.
JABBA	Your mind powers will not work on me, boy.
LUKE	Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers.
C-3PO	Master Luke, you're standing on...
JABBA	There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die. Bascka!
===	===
LUKE	Han!
HAN	Luke!
LUKE	Are you all right?
HAN	Fine. Together again, huh?
LUKE	Wouldn't miss it.
HAN	How are we doing?
LUKE	The same as always.
HAN	That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
LEIA	I'm here.
C-3PO	Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
HAN	Good, I hate long waits.
C-3PO	You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.
HAN	Doesn't sound so bad.
C-3PO	In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
HAN	On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
LUKE	You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever make.
===	===
HAN	I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
LUKE	There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
HAN	You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
LUKE	Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
HAN	Oh... great!
===	===
HAN	Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. Right?
LUKE	Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die.
===	===
LUKE	Easy, Chewie.
LANDO	Whoa! Whoa! Help!
===	===
LUKE	Get the gun! Point it at the deck! Point it at the deck!
C-3PO	Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump.
LUKE	Come on!
===	===
LUKE	Let's go! And don't forget the droids.
LANDO	We're on our way.
===	===
HAN	I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
LEIA	That's all any of us can see.
HAN	Then I guess I'm getting better. I've got to hand it to you, kid, you were pretty good out there.
LUKE	I had a lot of help. Think nothing of it.
HAN	No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest thing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide awake nothing!
LUKE	I'll see you back at the fleet.
HAN	Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
LUKE	I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
HAN	(looking dubiously at Lando, obviously remembering his friend's betrayal and subsequent aide) Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
LANDO	Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
LEIA	"He means ""You're welcome."""
LANDO	Come on, let's get off this miserable dust ball.
===	===
LUKE	I'll meet you back at the fleet.
LEIA	Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now.
LUKE	I will.
HAN	Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one.
LUKE	That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend.
===	===
YODA	Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?
LUKE	No... of course not.
YODA	I do, yes, I do!  Sick have I become. Old and weak. (Points a crooked finger) When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm? Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have.
LUKE	Master Yoda, you can't die.
YODA	Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things ... the way of the Force.
LUKE	But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
YODA	No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
LUKE	Then I am a Jedi?
YODA	Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.
LUKE	Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?
YODA	Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.
LUKE	Yoda, I must know.
YODA	Your father he is. Told you, did he?
LUKE	Yes.
YODA	Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
LUKE	Unfortunate that I know the truth?
YODA	No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you.
LUKE	Well, I'm sorry.
YODA	Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I (cough), the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... (with great effort) There is... another...Sky...Sky...walker.
===	===
LUKE	I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.
OBI-WAN	Yoda will always be with you.
LUKE	Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me? You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
OBI-WAN	You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.
LUKE	A certain point of view!
OBI-WAN	Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. I don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it certainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened to your father was my fault. Anakin was a good friend. When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him.  I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi.  I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda.  I was wrong.  My pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy.
LUKE	There's still good in him.
OBI-WAN	I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
LUKE	I can't do it, Ben.
OBI-WAN	You cannot escape your destiny.
LUKE	I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
OBI-WAN	Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke...but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience.  Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
LUKE	But I had to help my friends.
OBI-WAN	And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved little by rushing back prematurely, I fear.
LUKE	I found out Darth Vader was my father.
OBI-WAN	To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
LUKE	I can't kill my own father.
OBI-WAN	Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
LUKE	Yoda spoke of another.
OBI-WAN	The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
LUKE	But I have no sister.
OBI-WAN	Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
LUKE	Leia! Leia's my sister.
OBI-WAN	Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor. When your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your mother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible.  So I took you to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan. The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew she'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power, since Alderaan had long been a democracy.  Even so, the family continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster father's path, became a senator as well.  That's not all she became, of course... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause.  That's what she was doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became desperate.
LUKE	But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
OBI-WAN	She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke ... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!

HAN	Well, look at you, a general, huh?
LANDO	Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
HAN	Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack.
LANDO	I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.
HAN	Well, who says they didn't.  But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember?
MON MOTHMA	The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come. The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star. Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.
ACKBAR	You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor. General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack
HAN	Good luck. You're gonna need it.
ACKBAR	General Madine.
GENERAL MADINE	We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator.
C-3PO	Sounds dangerous.
LEIA	I wonder who they found to pull that off.
GENERAL MADINE	General Solo, is your strike team assembled?
HAN	Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle. Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you. That's one.
LEIA	Uh, General... count me in.
VOICE	I'm with you, too!
LEIA	What is it?
LUKE	Ask me again sometime.
HAN	Luke.
LUKE	Hi, Han... Chewie.
C-3PO	Exciting is hardly the word I would use.
===	===
HAN	You got her warmed?
LUKE	Yeah, she's comin' up.
HAN	No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
LEIA	Hey, are you awake?
HAN	Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
LEIA	Come on, General, let's move.
HAN	Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
LUKE	All set.
C-3PO	Here we go again.
HAN	All right, hang on.
===	===
HAN	If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
CONTROLLER	We have you on our screen now. Please identify.
HAN	Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.
CONTROLLER	Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage.
HAN	Transmission commencing.
LEIA	Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
HAN	It'll work. It'll work.
LUKE	Vader's on that ship.
HAN	Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance. I don't know.  Fly casual.
LUKE	I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
HAN	It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.
===	===
HAN	Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
LUKE	Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
HAN	Hey... it's me.
SCOUT	Go for help! Go!
LUKE	Great. Come on.
LEIA	Over there! Two more of them!
LUKE	I see them. Wait, Leia! Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch!
HAN	Hey, wait! Ahhh!
===	===
LUKE	Move closer! Get alongside that one! Get him! Keep on that one! I'll take these two!
===	===
C-3PO	Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!
HAN	Luke! Where's Leia?
LUKE	What? She didn't come back?
HAN	I thought she was with you.
LUKE	We got separated. Hey, we better go look for her.
HAN	Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
LUKE	Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
C-3PO	Don't worry, Master Luke.  We know what to do. And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!
===	===
HAN	Luke! Luke!
C-3PO	Oh, Master Luke.
LUKE	There's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.
C-3PO	I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.
HAN	I hope she's alright. What, Chewie? What? Chewie!
===	===
HAN	Hey, I don't get it. Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie.
LUKE	Chewie, wa-wait!  Don't!
HAN	Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.
LUKE	Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. (trying to free an arm) Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
HAN	Yeah, sure.
C-3PO	Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-op!!
HAN	Wha--?  Hey!  Point that thing someplace else. Hey!
LUKE	Han, don't. It'll be all right. Chewie, give 'em your crossbow.
C-3PO	Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness!
LUKE	Do you understand anything they're saying?
C-3PO	Oh, yes, Master Luke!  Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication.
HAN	What are you telling them?
C-3PO	Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
HAN	Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
C-3PO	I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
HAN	Proper?!
C-3PO	It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
HAN	Why, you-- My mistake. He's an old friend of mine.
===	===
HAN	I have a really bad feeling about this. What did he say?
C-3PO	I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
HAN	Leia!
LEIA	Oh!
C-3PO	Your Royal Highness.
LEIA	But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free.
HAN	Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
LUKE	Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
C-3PO	But Master Luke, what magic? couldn't possibly --
LUKE	Just tell them.
C-3PO	You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just... ... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh! Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh! Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness.
LUKE	Thanks, Threepio.
C-3PO	I...I never knew I had it in me.
===	===
LUKE	Luke, what's wrong? Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
LEIA	Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
LUKE	What do you remember?
LEIA	Just...images, really. Feelings.
LUKE	Tell me.
LEIA	(a little surprised at his insistence) She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. (looks up) Why are you asking me all this?
LUKE	I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
LEIA	Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
LUKE	Vader is here...now, on this moon.
LEIA	How do you know?
LUKE	I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. (facing her) As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here. (beat) I have to face him.
LEIA	Why?
LUKE	He's my father.
LEIA	Your father?
LUKE	There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.
LEIA	Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
LUKE	You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it. Yes. It's you Leia.
LEIA	I know. Somehow...I've always known.
LUKE	Then you know why I have to face him.
LEIA	No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
LUKE	No, you don't. You've always been strong.
LEIA	But, why must you confront him?
LUKE	Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.
HAN	Hey, what's goin' on?
LEIA	Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.
HAN	Nothing?  Come on, tell me.  What's goin' on?
LEIA	I...I can't tell you.
HAN	Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?
LEIA	I...
HAN	Ahhh... I'm sorry.
LEIA	Hold me.
===	===
COMMANDER	This is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area. He was armed only with this.
VADER	Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his companions to me.
COMMANDER	Yes, my Lord.
VADER	The Emperor has been expecting you.
LUKE	I know, father.
VADER	So, you have accepted the truth.
LUKE	I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father.
VADER	That name no longer has any meaning for me.
LUKE	It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now.
VADER	I see you have constructed a new lightsaber. Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen.
LUKE	Come with me.
VADER	Obi-Wan once thought as you do. You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
LUKE	I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
VADER	If that is your destiny.
LUKE	Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
VADER	It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.
LUKE	Then my father is truly dead.
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you. You no longer need those. Guards, leave us. I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call me Master.
LUKE	You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
VADER	His lightsaber.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with you.
LUKE	You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet. Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here.
LUKE	Your overconfidence is your weakness.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Your faith in your friends is yours.
VADER	It is pointless to resist, my son.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design. (indicates Endor) Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon... ...are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them. Oh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive.
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	Come, boy. See for yourself. From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion. You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant.
LUKE	No!
DARTH SIDIOUS	It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine!
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	Good.  Use your aggressive feelings, boy!  Let the hate flow through you.
VADER	Obi-Wan has taught you well.
LUKE	I will not fight you, father.
VADER	You are unwise to lower your defenses.
LUKE	Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
VADER	There is no conflict.
LUKE	You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
VADER	You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Good.  Good.
===	===
VADER	You cannot hide forever, Luke.
LUKE	I will not fight you.
VADER	Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for... Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
LUKE	Never-r-r!
DARTH SIDIOUS	Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side!
LUKE	Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me.
DARTH SIDIOUS	So be it...Jedi.
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed. Young fool...only now, at the end, do you understand. Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You have paid the price for your lack of vision.
LUKE	Father, please. Help me.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Now, young Skywalker...you will die.
===	===
VADER	Luke, help me take this mask off.
LURE	But you'll die.
VADER	Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes.
ANAKIN	Now...go, my son. Leave me.
LUKE	No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you.
ANAKIN	You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right.
LUKE	Father... I won't leave you.
===	===
LUKE	Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you read me?
HAN	Loud and clear, kid. What's up?
LUKE	Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings.
HAN	There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. The sensors are placed. I'm going back.
LUKE	Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long. Hey, steady girl. What's the matter? You smell something? Aaargh!
===	===
OBI-WAN	Luke...Luke.
LUKE	Ben?
OBI-WAN	You will go to the Dagobah system.
LUKE	Dagobah system?
OBI-WAN	There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me.
LUKE	Ben...Ben.
HAN	Luke! Luke! Don't do this, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here. Not much time.
LUKE	Ben...Ben...
HAN	Hang on, kid.
LUKE	Dagobah system...
HAN	Whew...
LUKE	Dagobah...
HAN	This may smell bad, kid...
LUKE	Yoda...
HAN	...but it will keep you warm...til I get the shelter built. (struggling to get Luke in the carcass) Ooh...I thought they smelled bad on the outside!
===	===
C-3PO	Master Luke, sir, it's good to see you fully functional again. Artoo expresses his relief, also.
HAN	How are you feeling, kid? You don't look so bad to me. In fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark.
LUKE	Thanks to you.
HAN	That's two you owe me, junior. Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer.
LEIA	I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield.
HAN	That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.
LEIA	I don't know where you get you delusions, laser brain.
HAN	Laugh it up, fuzz ball. But you didn't see us alone in the south passage. She expressed her true feelings for me.
LEIA	My...! Why, you stuck up,...half-witted,...scruffy-looking... nerf-herder!
HAN	Who's scruffy-looking?  I must have hit her pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?
LEIA	Why, I guess you don't know everything about women yet?
ANNOUNCER	Headquarters personnel, report to command center.
HAN	Take it easy.
C-3PO	Excuse us, please.
===	===
MEDICAL DROID	Sir, it will take quite awhile to evacuate the T-forty- sevens.
LUKE	Well, forget the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports.
MEDICAL DROID	Take care, sir.
LUKE	Thanks.
===	===
LUKE	Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?
HAN	Hi, kid.  There's got to be a reason for it. Check it at the other end. Wait a second. (to Luke) You all right?
LUKE	Yeah.
HAN	Be careful.
LUKE	You, too.
===	===
ANNOUNCER	The first transport is away.
DACK	Feeling all right, sir?
LUKE	Just like new, Dack. How about you?
DACK	Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself.
LUKE	I know what you mean.
===	===
LUKE	Echo station Five-Seven. We're on our way.
===	===
LUKE	All right, boys, keep tight now.
DACK	Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set.
LUKE	Steady, Dack. Attack pattern delta. Go now!
===	===
LUKE	All right, I'm coming in. Hobbie, you still with me?
===	===
LUKE	That armor's too strong for blasters. Rouge Group, use your harpoons and tow cables. Go for the legs. It might be our only chance of stopping them. (to Dack) All right, stand by, Dack.
DACK	Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control. I'll have to cut in the auxiliary.
LUKE	Just hang on. Hang on, Dack. Get ready to fire that tow cable.
===	===
LUKE	Dack? Dack!
===	===
LUKE	Rouge Three.
===	===
WEDGE	Copy, Rouge Leader
LUKE	Wedge, I've lost my gunner. You'll have to make this shot. I'll cover for you. Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass.
WEDGE	Coming around, Rouge Leader.
===	===
LUKE	Steady, Rouge Two
===	===
LUKE	I see it, Wedge. Good work.
===	===
LUKE	Rouge Two, are you all right?
===	===
LUKE	We'll set harpoon. I'll cover for you.
===	===
LUKE	Watch that cross fire, boys.
===	===
ZEV	Set for position three.  Steady.
LUKE	Stay tight and low.
===	===
LUKE	Hobbie, I've been hit!
===	===
LUKE	Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff.
WEDGE	Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous.
LUKE	Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going.
===	===
LUKE	There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course. We're not going to regroup with the others. We're going to the Dagobah system. Yes, Artoo? That's all right. I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while.
===	===
LUKE	Yes, that's it. Dagobah. No, I'm not going to change my mind about this. (getting a little nervous) I'm not picking up any cities or technology. Massive life-form readings, though. There's something alive down there... Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids.
===	===
LUKE	I know, I know! All the scopes are dead. I can't see a thing! Just hang on, I'm going to start the landing cycle...
===	===
LUKE	No, Artoo, you stay put. I'll have a look around. Artoo? Artoo! Where are you? Artoo! You be more careful. Artoo -- that way! Artoo! Oh, no! Are you all right? Come on. You're lucky you don't taste very good. Anything broken? If you're saying coming here was a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree with you. Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here? It's like... something out of a dream, or, I don't know. Maybe I'm just going crazy.
===	===
LUKE	Ready for some power? Okay. Let's see now. Put that in there. There you go. Now all I have to do is find this Yoda...if he even exists. Still...there's something familiar about this place. I feel like...I don't know...
STRANGE VOICE	Feel like what?
LUKE	Like we're being watched!
YODA	Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm. I am wondering, why are you here?
LUKE	I'm looking for someone.
YODA	Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm?
LUKE	Right.
YODA	Help you I can. Yes, mmmm.
LUKE	I don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior.
YODA	Ahhh! A great warrior.  Wars not make one great.
LUKE	Put that down. Hey! That's my dinner.
YODA	How you get so big, eating food of this kind?
LUKE	Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just...
YODA	Aww, cannot get your ship out?
LUKE	Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh...you're making a mess. Hey, give me that!
YODA	Mine! Or I will help you not.
LUKE	I don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole.
YODA	Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is. Ah, ah, ah!
LUKE	Oh, Artoo, let him have it.
YODA	Mine! Mine!
LUKE	Artoo!
YODA	Mine!
LUKE	Now will you move along, little fella? We're got a lot of work to do.
YODA	No! No, no! Stay and help you, I will.  Find your friend, hmm?
LUKE	I'm not looking for a friend, I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
YODA	Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda.
LUKE	You know him?
YODA	Mmm. Take you to him, I will.  Yes, yes. But now, we must eat. Come. Good food. Come. Come, come.
LUKE	Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo.
===	===
LUKE	Look, I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we can't see Yoda now.
YODA	Patience! For the Jedi it is time to eat as well. Eat, eat. Hot. Good food, hm? Good, hmm?
LUKE	How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there?
YODA	Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him. (tasting food from the pot) Rootleaf, I cook. Why wish you become Jedi? Hm?
LUKE	Mostly because of my father, I guess.
YODA	Ah, your father. Powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi, mmm.
LUKE	Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am. (fed up) Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time.
YODA	I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience.
OBI-WAN	He will learn patience.
YODA	Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father.
OBI-WAN	Was I any different when you taught me?
YODA	Hah. He is not ready.
LUKE	Yoda! I am ready. I...Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm ready.
YODA	Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. (to the invisible Ben, indicating Luke) This one a long time have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. (turning to Luke) You are reckless!
OBI-WAN	So was I, if you'll remember.
YODA	He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training.
LUKE	But I've learned so much.
YODA	Will he finished what he begins?
LUKE	I won't fail you -- I'm not afraid.
YODA	Oh, you will be. You will be.
===	===
YODA	Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger...fear...aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.
LUKE	Vader. Is the dark side stronger?
YODA	No...no...no. Quicker, easier, more seductive.
LUKE	But how am I to know the good side from the bad?
YODA	You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.
LUKE	But tell me why I can't...
YODA	No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmm.
LUKE	There's something not right here. I feel cold, death.
YODA	That place...is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go.
LUKE	What's in there?
YODA	Only what you take with you. Your weapons...you will not need them.
===	===
YODA	Use the Force. Yes... Now...the stone. Feel it. Concentrate!
LUKE	Oh, no. We'll never get it out now.
YODA	So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say?
LUKE	Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally different.
YODA	No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned.
LUKE	All right, I'll give it a try.
YODA	No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.
LUKE	I can't. It's too big.
YODA	Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm? Mmmm. And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It's energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we...(Yoda pinches Luke's shoulder)...not this crude matter. (a sweeping gesture) You must feel the Force around you. (gesturing) Here, between you...me...the tree...the rock...everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship!
LUKE	You want the impossible. I don't...I don't believe it.
YODA	That is why you fail.
===	===
YODA	Concentrate...feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm, yes. Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future...the past. Old friends long gone.
LUKE	Han! Leia!
YODA	Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control.
LUKE	I saw...I saw a city in the clouds.
YODA	Mmm. Friends you have there.
LUKE	They were in pain.
YODA	It is the future you see.
LUKE	Future? Will they die?
YODA	Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.
LUKE	I've got to go to them.
YODA	Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.
===	===
YODA	Luke! You must complete the training.
LUKE	I can't keep the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I've got to help them.
YODA	You must not go!
LUKE	But Han and Leia will die if I don't.
OBI-WAN	You don't know that. Even Yoda cannot see their fate.
LUKE	But I can help them! I feel the Force!
OBI-WAN	But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force.
YODA	Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure at the cave!
LUKE	But I've learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to return and finish what I've begun. You have my word.
OBI-WAN	It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. that is why your friends are made to suffer.
LUKE	And that is why I have to go.
OBI-WAN	Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost Vader.
LUKE	You won't.
YODA	Stopped they must be. On this depends. Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil.
OBI-WAN	Patience.
LUKE	And sacrifice Han and Leia?
YODA	If you honor what they fight for...yes!
OBI-WAN	If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot interfere.
LUKE	I understand.  Artoo, fire up the converters.
OBI-WAN	Luke, don't give in to hate -- that leads to the dark side.
YODA	Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.
LUKE	I will. And I'll return. I promise.
YODA	Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse.
OBI-WAN	That boy is our last hope.
YODA	No. There is another.
===	===
LUKE	No, Threepio's with them. Just hang on. We're almost there.
===	===
VADER	You have learned much, young one.
LUKE	You'll find I'm full of surprises.
VADER	Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be true.
LUKE	No!
VADER	All to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor thought. Impressive...most impressive. Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear... now release your anger. Only your hatred can destroy me.
===	===
VADER	You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did. There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.
LUKE	I'll never join you!
VADER	If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.
LUKE	He told me enough! He told me you killed him.
VADER	No. I am your father.
LUKE	No. No. That's not true! That's impossible!
VADER	Search your feelings. You know it to be true.
LUKE	No! No! No!
VADER	Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It's the only way.
===	===
LUKE	Ben...Ben, please! Ben. Leia! Hear me! Leia!
===	===
LUKE	Oh, Leia.
LANDO	All right, Chewie. Let's go.
===	===
LUKE	Father.
===	===
LUKE	Ben, why didn't you tell me?
===	===
LUKE	It's Vader.
===	===
LUKE	Ben, why didn't you tell me?
===	===
LANDO	Luke, we're ready for takeoff.
LUKE	Good luck, Lando
LANDO	When we find Jabba the Hut and that bounty hunter, we'll contact you.
===	===
LUKE	I'll meet you at the rendezvous point on Tatooine.
===	===
LUKE	Chewie, I'll be waiting for your signal. Take care, you two. May the Force be with you. Ow!
===	===
