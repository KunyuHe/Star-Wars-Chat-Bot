CAMIE	It was just Wormie on another rampage.
LUKE	Shape it up you guys!...  Biggs? I didn't know you were back! When did you get in?
BIGGS	Just now.  I wanted to surprise you, hot shot.  I thought you'd be here... certainly didn't expect you to be out working.
LUKE	The Academy didn't change you much... but you're back so soon? Hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission?
BIGGS	Of course I got it.  Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last week. First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service... ... I just came back to say goodbye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons.
LUKE	I almost forgot.  There's a battle going on!  Right here in our system. Come and look!
===	===
BIGGS	That's no battle, hot shot... they're just sitting there!  Probably a freighter-tanker refueling.
LUKE	But there was a lot of firing earlier... Hey, easy with those...
===	===
BIGGS	You ought to take it a little easy Luke.  You may be the hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous.  Keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall.
LUKE	Look who's talking.  Now that you've been around those giant starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle. You've gotten soft in the city...
BIGGS	I've missed you kid.
LUKE	Well, things haven't been the same since you left, Biggs.  It's been so...quiet.
BIGGS	Luke, I didn't come back just to say goodbye...  I shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust... and if I don't come back, I want somebody to know.
LUKE	What are you talking about?
BIGGS	I made some friends at the Academy. ... when our frigate goes to one of the central systems, we're going to jump ship and join the Alliance...
LUKE	Join the Rebellion?!  Are you kidding!  How?
BIGGS	Quiet down will ya!  You got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater!
LUKE	I'm sorry.  I'm quiet. Listen how quiet I am.  You can barely hear me...
BIGGS	My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact.
LUKE	You√ïre crazy!  You could wander around forever trying to find them.
BIGGS	I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them I'll do what I can on my own...  It's what we always talked about.  Luke, I'm not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service.  The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side - the side I believe in.
LUKE	And I'm stuck here...
BIGGS	I thought you were going to the Academy next term.  You'll get your chance to get off this rock.
LUKE	Not likely!  I had to cancel my application.  There has been a lot of unrest among the Sand People since you left... they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead.
BIGGS	Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sand People with one blaster.
LUKE	I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off.  He needs me for just one more season. I can't leave him now.
BIGGS	I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important. What good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire?...  You know they're starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems... it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the Empire.
LUKE	It couldn't happen here.  You said it yourself.  The Empire won't bother with this rock.
BIGGS	Things always change.
LUKE	I wish I was going...  Are you going to be around long?
BIGGS	No, I'm leaving in the morning...
LUKE	Then I guess I won't see you.
BIGGS	Maybe someday...  I'll keep a lookout.
LUKE	Well, I'll be at the Academy next season... after that who knows.  I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that's for sure...  Take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend I've got.
===	===
BERU	Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.
LUKE	It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him.
OWEN	Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you?  I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner.
LUKE	But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters...
OWEN	You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done.  Now, come on, get to it!
LUKE	All right, come on!  And the red one, come on.  Well, come on, Red, let's go. Uncle Owen...
OWEN	Yeah?
LUKE	This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look!
C-3PO	Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition.  A real bargain.
LUKE	Uncle Owen...
OWEN	Yeah?
LUKE	What about that one?
OWEN	What about that blue one?  We'll take that one.
LUKE	Yeah, take it away.
C-3PO	Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir.  He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before.  Here he comes.
LUKE	Okay, let's go.
===	===
C-3PO	Thank the maker!  This oil bath is going to feel so good.  I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!
LUKE	It just isn't fair.  Oh, Biggs is right.  I'm never gonna get out of here!
C-3PO	Is there anything I might do to help?
LUKE	Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!
C-3PO	I don't think so, sir.  I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.  Not on this planet, anyways.  As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.
LUKE	Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.
C-3PO	I see, sir.
LUKE	Uh, you can call me Luke.
C-3PO	I see, sir Luke.
LUKE	Just Luke.
C-3PO	And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.
LUKE	Hello. You got a lot of carbon scoring here.  It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.
C-3PO	With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.
LUKE	You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?
C-3PO	That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.
LUKE	Have you been in many battles?
C-3PO	Several, I think.  Actually, there's not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.
LUKE	Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good.  Were you on a starcruiser or...
LEIA	Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.
LUKE	What's this?
C-3PO	Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction.  Old data. Pay it no mind.
LUKE	Who is she?  She's beautiful.
C-3PO	I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.  A person of some importance, sir - I believe.  Our captain was attached to...
LUKE	Is there more to this recording?
C-3PO	Behave yourself, Artoo.  You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him.  He's our new master. He says he's the property of Obi- Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts.  And it's a private message for him.  Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what he's talking about.  Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.
LUKE	Obi-Wan Kenobi?  I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?
C-3PO	I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?
LUKE	Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea.  He's kind of a strange old hermit. I wonder who she is.  It sounds like she's in trouble.  I'd better play back the whole thing.
C-3PO	He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system.  He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.
LUKE	H'm?  Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off!  Okay. There you go. Well, wait a minute.  Where'd she go?  Bring her back!  Play back the entire message.
AUNT BERU	Luke?  Luke!  Come to dinner!
LUKE	All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.
C-3PO	I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.
LUKE	Well, see what you can do with him.  I'll be right back.
===	===
OWEN	What makes you think that?
LUKE	Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him.  He says he belongs to someone called Obi- Wan Kenobi. I thought he might have meant Ben. Do you know what he's talking about?  Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben.
OWEN	That old man's just a crazy wizard.  Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That'll be the end of it.  It belongs to us now.
LUKE	But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?
OWEN	He won't, I don't think he exists any more.  He died about the same time as your father.
LUKE	He knew my father?
OWEN	I told you to forget it.  Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow.  In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.
LUKE	Yes, sir.  I think those new droids are going to work out fine.  In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season.  And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.
OWEN	You mean the next semester before harvest?
LUKE	Sure, there're more than enough droids.
OWEN	Harvest is when I need you the most.  Only one more season. This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands.  And then you can go to the Academy next year. You must understand I need you here, Luke.
LUKE	But it's a whole 'nother year.
OWEN	Look, it's only one more season.
LUKE	Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.
AUNT BERU	Where are you going?
LUKE	It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those droids.
===	===
C-3PO	It wasn't my fault, sir.  Please don't deactivate me.  I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.
LUKE	Oh, no!
===	===
C-3PO	That R2 unit has always been a problem.  These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand.  Even I can't understand their logic at times.
LUKE	How could I be so stupid?  He's nowhere in sight.  Blast it!
C-3PO	Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?
LUKE	It's too dangerous with all the Sand People around.  We'll have to wait until morning.
OWEN	Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night.
LUKE	All right, I'll be there in a few minutes.  Boy, am I gonna get it. You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.
===	===
C-3PO	Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault.
LUKE	Sure.  He needs you.  He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...
C-3PO	Deactivate!  Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt...
LUKE	Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner.  It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator.
===	===
C-3PO	Master Luke here is your rightful owner.  We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me of your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.
LUKE	Well, come on. It's getting late. I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up.
C-3PO	If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop.
LUKE	No, he's not going to try anything. What's wrong with him now?
C-3PO	Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.
LUKE	Sand People!  Or worse!  Come on, let's have a look.  Come on.
===	===
OBI-WAN	Hello there!  Come here my little friend.  Don't be afraid. Don't worry, he'll be all right.
LUKE	What happened?
OBI-WAN	Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day.  You're fortunate you're still in one piece.
LUKE	Ben?  Ben Kenobi!  Boy, am I glad to see you!
OBI-WAN	The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly.  Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far?
LUKE	Oh, this little droid!  I think he's searching for his former master ...  I've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems to be no stopping him.  He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about?
OBI-WAN	Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan?  Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time.
LUKE	I think my uncle knew him.  He said he was dead.
OBI-WAN	Oh, he's not dead, no... not yet.
LUKE	You know him!
OBI-WAN	Well of course, of course I know him.  He's me!  I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.
LUKE	Then the droid does belong to you.
OBI-WAN	Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid.  Very interesting... I think we better get indoors. The Sand People are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.
LUKE	... Threepio!
===	===
C-3PO	Where am I?  I must have taken a bad step...
LUKE	Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before the Sand People return.
C-3PO	I don't think I can make it.  You go on, Master Luke.  There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
LUKE	No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that?
===	===
OBI-WAN	That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals.  Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.
LUKE	You fought in the Clone Wars?
OBI-WAN	Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.
LUKE	I wish I'd known him.
C-3PO	Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile.
LUKE	Sure, go ahead. What is it?
OBI-WAN	Your fathers lightsaber.  This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster. An elegant weapon for a more civilized time.  For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.  Before the dark times, before the Empire.
LUKE	How did my father die?
OBI-WAN	A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.  He betrayed and murdered your father.  Now the Jedi are all but extinct.  Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.
LUKE	The Force?
OBI-WAN	Well, the Force is what gives the Jedi his power.  It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend.  And where you come from.
LUKE	I saw part of the message he was...
OBI-WAN	You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.
LUKE	Alderaan?  I'm not going to Alderaan.  I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.
OBI-WAN	I need your help, Luke.  I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. She needs your help.
LUKE	I can't get involved!  I've got work to do!  It's not that I like the Empire.  I hate it!  But there's nothing I can do about it right now.  It's such a long way from here.
OBI-WAN	That's your uncle talking.
LUKE	Oh, God, my uncle.  How am I ever going to explain this?
OBI-WAN	Learn about the Force, Luke.
LUKE	Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.  You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
===	===
OBI-WAN	They didn't.  But we are meant to think they did.  These tracks are side by side.  Sand People always ride single file to hide there numbers.
LUKE	These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.
OBI-WAN	And these blast points, too accurate for Sand People.  Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
LUKE	Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas? If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to.  And that would lead them back home!
===	===
OBI-WAN	There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire.
LUKE	I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing here for me now.  I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.
===	===
TROOPER	How long have you had these droids?
LUKE	About three or four seasons.
===	===
C-3PO	I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures.
LUKE	Go on, go on.  I can't understand how we got by those troopers.  I thought we were dead.
OBI-WAN	The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.  You will find it a powerful ally.
LUKE	Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?
OBI-WAN	Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here.  Only watch your step.  This place can be a little rough.
LUKE	I'm ready for anything.
===	===
BARTENDER	We don't serve their kind here!
LUKE	What?
BARTENDER	Your droids. They'll have to wait outside.  We don't want them here.
LUKE	Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder.  We don't want any trouble.
HUMAN	He doesn't like you.
LUKE	I'm sorry.
HUMAN	I don't like you either Don't insult us.  You just watch yourself.  We're wanted men.  I have the death sentence on twelve systems.
LUKE	I'll be careful than.
===	===
HAN	Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?  And it's going to cost you something extra.  Ten thousand in advance.
LUKE	Ten thousand?  We could almost buy our own ship for that!
HAN	But who's going to fly it, kid! You?
LUKE	You bet I could.  I'm not such a bad pilot myself!  We don't have to sit here and listen...
===	===
OBI-WAN	You'll have to sell your speeder.
LUKE	That's okay.  I'm never coming back to this planet again.
===	===
HAN	Stay sharp!  There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off.
LUKE	Why don't you outrun them?  I thought you said this thing was fast.
===	===
HAN	It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi- computer.
LUKE	Are you kidding?  At the rate they're gaining...
HAN	Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!  Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?
LUKE	What's that flashing?
===	===
OBI-WAN	Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.
LUKE	You mean it controls your actions?
HAN	Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.
LUKE	You don't believe in the Force, do you?
OBI-WAN	I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.
LUKE	With the blast shield down, I can't even see.  How am I supposed to fight?
HAN	Look, going good against remotes is one thing.  Going good against the living?  That's something else. Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.
LUKE	You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote.
===	===
HAN	Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in the sublight engines. What the...?  Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts.
LUKE	What's going on?
HAN	Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!
LUKE	What do you mean?  Where is it?
HAN	Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid.  It ain't there.  It's been totally blown away.
LUKE	What?  How?
HAN	The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.  It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've... There's another ship coming in.
LUKE	Maybe they know what happened.
OBI-WAN	It's an Imperial fighter.
LUKE	It followed us!
===	===
OBI-WAN	A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.
LUKE	Then he must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something...
===	===
HAN	It's too big to be a space station.
LUKE	I have a very bad feeling about this.
HAN	Yeah, I think your right.  Full reverse!  Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
LUKE	Why are we still moving towards it?
HAN	We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in!
LUKE	But there's gotta be something you can do!
===	===
GANTRY OFFICER	TX-four-one-two.  Why aren't you at your post?  TX-four-one-two, do you copy? Take over.  We've got a bad transmitter.  I'll see what I can do.
LUKE	You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.
HAN	Whatever you say.  I've done more than I bargained for on this trip already.
LUKE	I want to go with you.
OBI-WAN	Be patient, Luke.  Stay and watch over the droids.
LUKE	But he can...
HAN	Boy you said it, Chewie. Where did you dig up that old fossil?
LUKE	Ben is a great man.
HAN	Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.
LUKE	I didn't hear you give any ideas...
HAN	Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for them to pick us up...
LUKE	Who do you think... What is it?
C-3PO	"I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says ""I found her,"" and keeps repeating, ""She's here."""
LUKE	Well, who... who has he found?
C-3PO	Princess Leia.
LUKE	The princess?  She's here?
HAN	Princess?
LUKE	Where... where is she?
C-3PO	Level five. Detention block AA- twenty-three.  I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.
LUKE	Oh, no!  We've got to do something.
HAN	What are you talking about?
LUKE	The droid belongs to her.  She's the one in the message.  We've got to help her.
HAN	Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.  The old man wants us to wait right here.
LUKE	But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?
HAN	I'm not going anywhere.
LUKE	They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured.  Now all you want to do is stay.
HAN	Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.
LUKE	But they're going to kill her!
HAN	Better her than me...
LUKE	She's rich.
HAN	Rich?
LUKE	Yes.  Rich, powerful!  Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...
HAN	What?
LUKE	Well more wealth that you can imagine.
HAN	I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!
LUKE	You'll get it!
HAN	I better!
LUKE	You will...
HAN	All right, kid.  But you'd better be right about this!
LUKE	All right.
HAN	What's your plan?
LUKE	Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders there will you? Okay.  Now, I'm going to put these on you. Okay.  Han, you put these on.
C-3PO	Master Luke, sir!  Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?
LUKE	Lock the door!
===	===
HAN	This is not going to work.
LUKE	Why didn't you say so before?
===	===
OFFICER	Where are you taking this... thing?
LUKE	Prisoner transfer from Block one- one-three-eight.
HAN	Look out!  He's loose!
LUKE	He's going to pull us all apart.
===	===
LEIA	Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?
LUKE	What?  Oh... the uniform.  I'm Luke Skywalker.  I'm here to rescue you.
LEIA	You're who?
LUKE	I'm here to rescue you.  I've got your R2 unit.  I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
LEIA	Ben Kenobi is here!  Where is he?
LUKE	Come on!
===	===
HAN	Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness.
LUKE	See-Threepio!  See-Threepio!
C-3PO	Yes sir?
LUKE	We've been cut off!  Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?... What was that?  I didn't copy!
===	===
HAN	He's the brains, sweetheart.
LUKE	Well, I didn't...
===	===
HAN	Oh!  The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea.  What an incredible smell you've discovered!  Let's get out of here!  Get away from there...
LUKE	No!  wait! Will you forget it?  I already tried it.  It's magnetically sealed!
HAN	It's worse.
LUKE	There's something alive in here!
HAN	That's your imagination.
LUKE	Something just moves past my leg! Look!  Did you see that?
HAN	What?
LUKE	Help!
LEIA	Luke! Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.
LUKE	Blast it, will you!  My gun's jammed.
HAN	Where?
LUKE	Anywhere!  Oh!!
LEIA	Grab him! What happened?
LUKE	I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared...
HAN	I've got a very bad feeling about this.
LUKE	The walls are moving!
LEIA	Don't just stand there.  Try and brace it with something.
LUKE	Wait a minute! Threepio!  Come in Threepio! Threepio!  Where could he be?
===	===
LEIA	I can't
LUKE	Where could he be?  Threepio! Threepio, will you come in?
===	===
C-3PO	We've had some problems...
LUKE	Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level, will you? Do you copy?
===	===
C-3PO	No.  Shut them all down!  Hurry! Listen to them!  They're dying, Artoo!  Curse my metal body!  I wasn't fast enough.  It's all my fault!  My poor master!
LUKE	Threepio, we're all right!
===	===
HAN	If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here.
LUKE	Well, let's get moving!
===	===
HAN	There she is.
LUKE	See-Threepio, do you copy?
C-3PO	For the moment.  Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship.
LUKE	We're right above you.  Stand by.
HAN	Get back to the ship!
LUKE	Where are you going?  Come back!
LEIA	He certainly has courage.
LUKE	What good will it do us if he gets himself killed?  Come on!
===	===
LEIA	There's no lock!
LUKE	That oughta hold it for a while.
LEIA	Quick, we've got to get across. Find the control that extends the bridge.
LUKE	Oh, I think I just blasted it.
LEIA	They're coming through!
LUKE	Here, hold this.
===	===
LEIA	We ran into some old friends.
LUKE	Is the ship all right?
===	===
HAN	Now's our chance!  Go!
LUKE	No!
===	===
LEIA	You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive! Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anyone.
LUKE	I care! So... what do you think of her, Han?
HAN	I'm trying not to, kid!
LUKE	Good...
HAN	Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me...
LUKE	No!
===	===
WEDGE	That's impossible, even for a computer.
LUKE	It's not impossible.  I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home.  They're not much bigger than two meters.
===	===
MAN	All flight troops, man your stations. All flight troops, man your stations.
LUKE	So... you got your reward and you're just leaving then?
HAN	That's right, yeah!  I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff.  Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you?  Why don't you come with us?  You're pretty good in a fight.  I could use you.
LUKE	Come on!  Why don't you take a look around?  You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.
HAN	What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?  Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage.  It's more like suicide.
LUKE	All right.  Well, take care of yourself, Han... guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?
===	===
LEIA	What's wrong?
LUKE	Oh, it's Han!  I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind.
LEIA	He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him.
LUKE	I only wish Ben were here.
BIGGS	Luke!  I don't believe it!  How'd you get here... are you going out with us?!
LUKE	Biggs!  Of course, I'll be up there with you!  Listen, have I got some stories to tell...
RED LEADER	I met your father once when I was just a boy.  He was a great pilot. You'll do all right.  If you've got half of your father's skill, you'll do better than all right.
LUKE	Thank you, sir.  I'll try.
BIGGS	I've got to get aboard.  Listen, you'll tell me your stories when we come back.  All right?
LUKE	I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.
CHIEF	This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up.  Do you want a new one?
LUKE	Not on your life!  That little droid and I have been through a lot together. You okay, Artoo?
===	===
RED ELEVEN	Red Eleven standing by.
LUKE	Red Five standing by.
===	===
RED LEADER	Watch yourself!  There's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower.
LUKE	I'm on it.
===	===
WEDGE	I'm hit!  I can't stay with you.
LUKE	Get clear, Wedge.
===	===
BASE VOICE	His computer's off.  Luke, you switched off your targeting computer.  What's wrong?
LUKE	Nothing.  I'm all right.
===	===
HAN	Hey!  Hey!
LUKE	I knew you'd come back!  I just knew it!
LEIA	Hey, I knew there was more to you than money.
LUKE	Oh, no!
C-3PO	You must repair him!  Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them.
LUKE	He'll be all right.
===	===
C-3PO	The message, Artoo, the message.
LUKE	Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. (Jabba's crowd laughs) With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids.
C-3PO	What did he say?
LUKE	... Both are hardworking and will serve you well.
===	===
JABBA	I told you not to admit him.
LUKE	I must be allowed to speak.
JABBA	You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick.
LUKE	You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.
JABBA	Your mind powers will not work on me, boy.
LUKE	Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers.
===	===
HAN	Luke!
LUKE	Are you all right?
HAN	Fine. Together again, huh?
LUKE	Wouldn't miss it.
HAN	How are we doing?
LUKE	The same as always.
HAN	On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
LUKE	You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever make.
===	===
HAN	I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
LUKE	There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
HAN	You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
LUKE	Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
===	===
HAN	Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. Right?
LUKE	Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die.
===	===
C-3PO	Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump.
LUKE	Come on!
===	===
HAN	Then I guess I'm getting better. I've got to hand it to you, kid, you were pretty good out there.
LUKE	I had a lot of help. Think nothing of it.
HAN	No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest thing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide awake nothing!
LUKE	I'll see you back at the fleet.
HAN	Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
LUKE	I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
===	===
LEIA	Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now.
LUKE	I will.
HAN	Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one.
LUKE	That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend.
===	===
YODA	Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?
LUKE	No... of course not.
YODA	I do, yes, I do!  Sick have I become. Old and weak. (Points a crooked finger) When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm? Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have.
LUKE	Master Yoda, you can't die.
YODA	Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things ... the way of the Force.
LUKE	But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
YODA	No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
LUKE	Then I am a Jedi?
YODA	Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.
LUKE	Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?
YODA	Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.
LUKE	Yoda, I must know.
YODA	Your father he is. Told you, did he?
LUKE	Yes.
YODA	Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
LUKE	Unfortunate that I know the truth?
YODA	No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you.
LUKE	Well, I'm sorry.
===	===
OBI-WAN	Yoda will always be with you.
LUKE	Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me? You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
OBI-WAN	You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.
LUKE	A certain point of view!
OBI-WAN	Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. I don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it certainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened to your father was my fault. Anakin was a good friend. When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him.  I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi.  I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda.  I was wrong.  My pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy.
LUKE	There's still good in him.
OBI-WAN	I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
LUKE	I can't do it, Ben.
OBI-WAN	You cannot escape your destiny.
LUKE	I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
OBI-WAN	Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke...but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience.  Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
LUKE	But I had to help my friends.
OBI-WAN	And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved little by rushing back prematurely, I fear.
LUKE	I found out Darth Vader was my father.
OBI-WAN	To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
LUKE	I can't kill my own father.
OBI-WAN	Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
LUKE	Yoda spoke of another.
OBI-WAN	The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
LUKE	But I have no sister.
OBI-WAN	Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
LUKE	Leia! Leia's my sister.
OBI-WAN	Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor. When your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your mother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible.  So I took you to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan. The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew she'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power, since Alderaan had long been a democracy.  Even so, the family continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster father's path, became a senator as well.  That's not all she became, of course... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause.  That's what she was doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became desperate.
LUKE	But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
===	===
LEIA	What is it?
LUKE	Ask me again sometime.
HAN	Luke.
LUKE	Hi, Han... Chewie.
===	===
HAN	You got her warmed?
LUKE	Yeah, she's comin' up.
HAN	Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
LUKE	All set.
===	===
HAN	It'll work. It'll work.
LUKE	Vader's on that ship.
HAN	Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance. I don't know.  Fly casual.
LUKE	I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
===	===
HAN	Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
LUKE	Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
SCOUT	Go for help! Go!
LUKE	Great. Come on.
LEIA	Over there! Two more of them!
LUKE	I see them. Wait, Leia! Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch!
===	===
HAN	Luke! Where's Leia?
LUKE	What? She didn't come back?
HAN	I thought she was with you.
LUKE	We got separated. Hey, we better go look for her.
HAN	Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
LUKE	Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
===	===
C-3PO	Oh, Master Luke.
LUKE	There's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.
===	===
HAN	Hey, I don't get it. Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie.
LUKE	Chewie, wa-wait!  Don't!
HAN	Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.
LUKE	Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. (trying to free an arm) Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
HAN	Wha--?  Hey!  Point that thing someplace else. Hey!
LUKE	Han, don't. It'll be all right. Chewie, give 'em your crossbow.
C-3PO	Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness!
LUKE	Do you understand anything they're saying?
===	===
HAN	Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
LUKE	Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
C-3PO	But Master Luke, what magic? couldn't possibly --
LUKE	Just tell them.
C-3PO	You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just... ... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh! Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh! Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness.
LUKE	Thanks, Threepio.
===	===
LEIA	Luke, what's wrong?
LUKE	Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
LEIA	Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
LUKE	What do you remember?
LEIA	Just...images, really. Feelings.
LUKE	Tell me.
LEIA	(a little surprised at his insistence) She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. (looks up) Why are you asking me all this?
LUKE	I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
LEIA	Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
LUKE	Vader is here...now, on this moon.
LEIA	How do you know?
LUKE	I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. (facing her) As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here. (beat) I have to face him.
LEIA	Why?
LUKE	He's my father.
LEIA	Your father?
LUKE	There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.
LEIA	Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
LUKE	You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it. Yes. It's you Leia.
LEIA	I know. Somehow...I've always known.
LUKE	Then you know why I have to face him.
LEIA	No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
LUKE	No, you don't. You've always been strong.
LEIA	But, why must you confront him?
LUKE	Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.
===	===
ANAKIN	The Emperor has been expecting you.
LUKE	I know, father.
ANAKIN	So, you have accepted the truth.
LUKE	I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father.
ANAKIN	That name no longer has any meaning for me.
LUKE	It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now.
ANAKIN	I see you have constructed a new lightsaber. Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen.
LUKE	Come with me.
ANAKIN	Obi-Wan once thought as you do. You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
LUKE	I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
ANAKIN	If that is your destiny.
LUKE	Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
ANAKIN	It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.
LUKE	Then my father is truly dead.
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you. You no longer need those. Guards, leave us. I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call me Master.
LUKE	You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with you.
LUKE	You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet. Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here.
LUKE	Your overconfidence is your weakness.
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	Come, boy. See for yourself. From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion. You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant.
LUKE	No!
===	===
ANAKIN	Obi-Wan has taught you well.
LUKE	I will not fight you, father.
ANAKIN	You are unwise to lower your defenses.
LUKE	Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
ANAKIN	There is no conflict.
LUKE	You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
===	===
ANAKIN	You cannot hide forever, Luke.
LUKE	I will not fight you.
ANAKIN	Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for... Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
LUKE	Never-r-r!
DARTH SIDIOUS	Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side!
LUKE	Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me.
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed. Young fool...only now, at the end, do you understand. Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You have paid the price for your lack of vision.
LUKE	Father, please. Help me.
===	===
ANAKIN	Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes. Now...go, my son. Leave me.
LUKE	No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you.
ANAKIN	You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right.
LUKE	Father... I won't leave you.
===	===
HAN	Loud and clear, kid. What's up?
LUKE	Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings.
HAN	There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. The sensors are placed. I'm going back.
LUKE	Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long. Hey, steady girl. What's the matter? You smell something? Aaargh!
===	===
OBI-WAN	Luke...Luke.
LUKE	Ben?
OBI-WAN	You will go to the Dagobah system.
LUKE	Dagobah system?
OBI-WAN	There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me.
LUKE	Ben...Ben.
HAN	Luke! Luke! Don't do this, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here. Not much time.
LUKE	Ben...Ben...
HAN	Hang on, kid.
LUKE	Dagobah system...
HAN	Whew...
LUKE	Dagobah...
HAN	This may smell bad, kid...
LUKE	Yoda...
===	===
HAN	How are you feeling, kid? You don't look so bad to me. In fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark.
LUKE	Thanks to you.
===	===
MEDICAL DROID	Sir, it will take quite awhile to evacuate the T-forty- sevens.
LUKE	Well, forget the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports.
MEDICAL DROID	Take care, sir.
LUKE	Thanks.
===	===
HAN	Hi, kid.  There's got to be a reason for it. Check it at the other end. Wait a second. (to Luke) You all right?
LUKE	Yeah.
HAN	Be careful.
LUKE	You, too.
===	===
DACK	Feeling all right, sir?
LUKE	Just like new, Dack. How about you?
DACK	Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself.
LUKE	I know what you mean.
===	===
DACK	Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set.
LUKE	Steady, Dack. Attack pattern delta. Go now!
===	===
DACK	Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control. I'll have to cut in the auxiliary.
LUKE	Just hang on. Hang on, Dack. Get ready to fire that tow cable.
===	===
WEDGE	Copy, Rouge Leader
LUKE	Wedge, I've lost my gunner. You'll have to make this shot. I'll cover for you. Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass.
===	===
ZEV	Set for position three.  Steady.
LUKE	Stay tight and low.
===	===
WEDGE	Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous.
LUKE	Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going.
===	===
STRANGE VOICE	Feel like what?
LUKE	Like we're being watched!
YODA	Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm. I am wondering, why are you here?
LUKE	I'm looking for someone.
YODA	Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm?
LUKE	Right.
YODA	Help you I can. Yes, mmmm.
LUKE	I don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior.
YODA	Ahhh! A great warrior.  Wars not make one great.
LUKE	Put that down. Hey! That's my dinner.
YODA	How you get so big, eating food of this kind?
LUKE	Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just...
YODA	Aww, cannot get your ship out?
LUKE	Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh...you're making a mess. Hey, give me that!
YODA	Mine! Or I will help you not.
LUKE	I don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole.
YODA	Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is. Ah, ah, ah!
LUKE	Oh, Artoo, let him have it.
YODA	Mine! Mine!
LUKE	Artoo!
YODA	Mine!
LUKE	Now will you move along, little fella? We're got a lot of work to do.
YODA	No! No, no! Stay and help you, I will.  Find your friend, hmm?
LUKE	I'm not looking for a friend, I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
YODA	Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda.
LUKE	You know him?
YODA	Mmm. Take you to him, I will.  Yes, yes. But now, we must eat. Come. Good food. Come. Come, come.
LUKE	Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo.
===	===
YODA	Patience! For the Jedi it is time to eat as well. Eat, eat. Hot. Good food, hm? Good, hmm?
LUKE	How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there?
YODA	Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him. (tasting food from the pot) Rootleaf, I cook. Why wish you become Jedi? Hm?
LUKE	Mostly because of my father, I guess.
YODA	Ah, your father. Powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi, mmm.
LUKE	Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am. (fed up) Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time.
YODA	Hah. He is not ready.
LUKE	Yoda! I am ready. I...Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm ready.
YODA	He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training.
LUKE	But I've learned so much.
YODA	Will he finished what he begins?
LUKE	I won't fail you -- I'm not afraid.
===	===
YODA	Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger...fear...aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.
LUKE	Vader. Is the dark side stronger?
YODA	No...no...no. Quicker, easier, more seductive.
LUKE	But how am I to know the good side from the bad?
YODA	You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.
LUKE	But tell me why I can't...
YODA	No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmm.
LUKE	There's something not right here. I feel cold, death.
YODA	That place...is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go.
LUKE	What's in there?
===	===
YODA	Use the Force. Yes... Now...the stone. Feel it. Concentrate!
LUKE	Oh, no. We'll never get it out now.
YODA	So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say?
LUKE	Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally different.
YODA	No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned.
LUKE	All right, I'll give it a try.
YODA	No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.
LUKE	I can't. It's too big.
YODA	Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm? Mmmm. And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It's energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we...(Yoda pinches Luke's shoulder)...not this crude matter. (a sweeping gesture) You must feel the Force around you. (gesturing) Here, between you...me...the tree...the rock...everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship!
LUKE	You want the impossible. I don't...I don't believe it.
===	===
YODA	Concentrate...feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm, yes. Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future...the past. Old friends long gone.
LUKE	Han! Leia!
YODA	Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control.
LUKE	I saw...I saw a city in the clouds.
YODA	Mmm. Friends you have there.
LUKE	They were in pain.
YODA	It is the future you see.
LUKE	Future? Will they die?
YODA	Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.
LUKE	I've got to go to them.
===	===
YODA	Luke! You must complete the training.
LUKE	I can't keep the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I've got to help them.
YODA	You must not go!
LUKE	But Han and Leia will die if I don't.
OBI-WAN	You don't know that. Even Yoda cannot see their fate.
LUKE	But I can help them! I feel the Force!
YODA	Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure at the cave!
LUKE	But I've learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to return and finish what I've begun. You have my word.
OBI-WAN	It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. that is why your friends are made to suffer.
LUKE	And that is why I have to go.
OBI-WAN	Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost Vader.
LUKE	You won't.
OBI-WAN	Patience.
LUKE	And sacrifice Han and Leia?
OBI-WAN	If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot interfere.
LUKE	I understand.  Artoo, fire up the converters.
YODA	Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.
LUKE	I will. And I'll return. I promise.

ANAKIN	You have learned much, young one.
LUKE	You'll find I'm full of surprises.
ANAKIN	Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be true.
LUKE	No!
===	===
ANAKIN	You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did. There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.
LUKE	I'll never join you!
ANAKIN	If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.
LUKE	He told me enough! He told me you killed him.
ANAKIN	No. I am your father.
LUKE	No. No. That's not true! That's impossible!
ANAKIN	Search your feelings. You know it to be true.
LUKE	No! No! No!

LANDO	Luke, we're ready for takeoff.
LUKE	Good luck, Lando
