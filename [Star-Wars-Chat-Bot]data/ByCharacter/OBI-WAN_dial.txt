There isn't a droid made that can out fly you, Master, and no other way to get to the Chancellor . . .
Look out, four droids inbound . . .
Break left, fly through the guns on that tower.
Easy for you to say . . . why am I always the bait?
Don't worry. I'm coming around behind you.
Anakin, they're all over me!
Dead ahead! Closing . . . lock onto him, Artoo . . . We got him, Artoo! I copy, Artoo.
I'm going down on the deck.
Good idea ... I need some room to maneuver. Cut right. Do you hear me?! Cut right. Don't let him get a handle on you. Come on, Artoo, lock on! Lock on!
Hurry up! I don't like this! Ouch! Don't even try to fix it, Arfour. I've shut it down.
We're locked on ... we've got him . . . Yeah! We got him . . . good going, Artoo.
Next time you're the bait . . . Now let's find the Command Ship and get on with it ...
Come on, Master.
Not this time. There's too much at stake. We need help. Odd Ball, do you copy?
Copy, Red Leader.
Mark my position and form your squad up behind me . . .
This is where the fun begins. Ten Vulture Droids straight ahead, coming down the left side.
Add five Tri-fighters on the right . . .
I'm going head to head. See you.
Take it easy, Anakin.
Incoming!!
Five more on the right!
Here we go.
I'm going high and right.
Hang on. There are four more of them.
Stay with me . . . swing back and right . . . help me engage. Back off ... Let them pass between us.
I'm coming around. I'm coming around on your tail.
All right, engage . . . and hurry. These droids are all over me like a rash.
How many back there. Artoo?  Three . . .  Four . . . that's not good.
Anakin, you have four on your tail.
I know. I know!
Four more closing from your left.
I know. I know!
Break right and go high.
I'm going low and left.
He still has much to learn.
Hang on, Artoo. Obi-Wan, do you copy? I'm going to pull them through the needle . . .
Too dangerous. First Jedi rule: "Survive."
Sorry, no choice. Come down here and thin them out a little.
Just keep me steady . . . hold on ... not yet. . . now break left. You'll never get through there, Anakin. It's too tight.
Easy, Artoo . . . we've done this before.
Use the Force, think yourself through, the ship will follow.
I'm going to go help them out!
No, no! They are doing their job so we can do ours. Head for the Command Ship!
Missiles! Pull up!
They overshot us . . .
They're coming around!
All right, Arfour. No, no. Nothing too fancy.
Surge all power units. Artoo! Stand by the reverse thrusters. We got 'em. Artoo!
Flying is for droids. I'm hit! Anakin?
I see them . . . Buzz Droids.
Arfour, be careful. You have one . . . Oh dear. They're shutting down all the controls.
Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.
The mission. Get to the Command Ship. Get the Chancellor! I'm running out of tricks here. In the name of ...
Steady . . . steady . . .
Anakin, hold your fire . . . hold your fire. You're not helping here.
I agree, bad idea. Swing right . . . ease over . . . steady . . .
Wait . . . wait . . . I can't see a thing! My cockpit's fogging. They're all over me, Anakin.
Move to the right.
Hold on, Anakin. You're going to get us both killed! Get out of here. There's nothing more you can do.
I'm not leaving without you, Master.
Blast it ... I can't see . . . my controls are gone.
Get 'em, Artoo. Watch out!
Artoo, hit the buzz droid's center eye.
Yeah, you got him!
Great, Artoo.
Stay on my wing . . . the General's Command Ship is dead ahead. Easy . . . pull up ... Head for the hangar.
Have you noticed the shields are still up?
Oh?!? Sorry, Master.
Oh, I have a bad feeling about this.
Tap into the ship's computers.
The Chancellor's signal is coming from right there. The observation platform at the top of that spire.
I sense Count Dooku . . .
I sense a trap.
Next move?
Spring the trap.
Artoo, go back. I need you to stay with the ship.
Here, take this, and wait for orders.
General Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker. We've been waiting for you.
We are here to relieve you of Chancellor Palpatine, not join him. Anakin. . .
Well then, we're safe for the time being.
Your idea of safe is not the same as mine.
They're sealing this section off.
Six droids coming our way!
Keep moving. There must be vents . . . This way.
We'll never get through that. It's too small!
I found our escape vent.
Anakin, this is no time for jokes. We're in serious trouble here.
The blast will break the hull. This side's pressurized.
You still have much to learn, Anakin.
No, did you?
No!
Well, there's more than one way out of here.
We don't want to get out, we want to get moving. Artoo . . . Artoo. Do you copy? Activate elevator . . .  . . . 31174 . . .
There it is again.
Artoo, do you copy? Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we need to be going up, not down.
What was that all about?
Well, Artoo has been . . .
No loose wire jokes . . . He's doing the best he can.
Did I say anything?
He's trying!
I didn't say anything!
Count Dooku.
This time we will do it together.
Get help! You're no match for him. He's a Sith Lord.
Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty.
Your swords, please, Master Jedi. We don't want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor.
You won't get away this time, Dooku.
Easy. . . . We're in a bit of a situation.
Did I miss something?
Hold on.
What is that? Oops.
Artoo, Artoo, shut down the elevator!
Too late! Jump!
I don't know.
Don't look at me. I don't know.
Here, Chancellor, lock this around your waist, and hold on.
We'll head toward the bridge and see if we can find an escape pod.
Ray shields!
Wait a minute, how'd this happen! We're smarter than this.
Apparently not, Master. This is the oldest trap in the book . . . Well ... I was distracted.
Oh, so all of a sudden it's my fault.
You're the Master. I'm just a hero.
I'm open to suggestions here.
I say . . . patience.
Patience! That's your plan, is it?
Don't move, dummy. Ouch! Zap this.
Do you have a plan B?
Oh yes. General Kenobi, the Negotiator. We've been waiting for you. That wasn't much of a rescue.
That depends upon your point of view. Hah!
Ahhhh, Jedi scum . . .
Anakin, try not to upset him. We have a job to do.
Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection.
Not this time. And this time you won't escape.
All the escape pods have been launched.
Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?
You mean, do I know how to land what's left of this thing?
Well?
Under the circumstances, I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant. Strap yourselves in.
Steady . . . Attitude . . . eighteen degrees.
Pressure rising. We've got to slow this wreck down. Open all hatches, extend all flaps, and drag fins.
Temp steady. Hatches open, flaps extended, drag fins . . .
We lost something.
Not to worry, we're still flying half the ship.
Now we're really picking up speed . . . I'm going to shift a few degrees and see if I can slow us down.
Careful . . . we're heating up-twelve thousand . . . thirteen thousand . . .
What's our speed?
Eight plus sixty-forty. Eight plus sixty-twenty. Eight plus sixty. Temp ten thousand, nine thousand . . . we're in the atmosphere . . .
Grab that . . . Keep us level.
Steady. Steady.
Easy, Artoo. Hang on, this may get a little rough. We lost our heat shields.
Five thousand. Three thousand . . . two thousand. Fireships on the left and the right.
We'll take you in.
Copy that. Landing strip's straight ahead.
We're coming in too hot.
Easy-easy.
Are you coming, Master?
Oh no. I'm not brave enough for politics. I have to report to the Council. Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy.
Hold on, this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time.
Sorry, old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor, carrying me unconscious on your back, and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely . . .
All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness.
. . . the endless speeches . . . Anakin, let's be fair. Today, you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.
All right. But you owe me . . . and not for saving your skin for the tenth time . . .
Ninth time . . . that business on Cato Nemoidia doesn't count. I'll see you at the briefing.
I'm sorry, I was held up. I have no excuse.
In short, they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.
What's wrong then?
The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today.
Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war.
Anakin, be careful of your friend Palpatine.
Be careful of what?
He has requested your presence.
What for?
He would not say.
He didn't inform the Jedi Council? That's unusual, isn't it?
All of this is unusual, and it's making me feel uneasy. You're probably aware that relations between the Council and the Chancellor are stressed.
I know the Council has grown wary of the Chancellor's power, mine also for that matter. Aren't we all working together to save the Republic? Why all this distrust?
The Force grows dark, Anakin, and we are all affected by it. Be wary of your feelings.
Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep.
It may take some time . . . we do not have many ships to spare.
We cannot take ships from the front line.
And yet, it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup.
It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately!
He's right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It's the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant.
What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the Council and not make me a Master!?? That's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting!
Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age . . . It's never happened before. Listen to me, Anakin. The fact of the matter is you're too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.
I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the Council . . .
But it's what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.
That has nothing to do with this.
Anakin, regardless of how it happened, you find yourself in a delicate situation.
You mean divided loyalties.
I warned you there was tension between the Council and the Chancellor. I was very clear. Why didn't you listen? You walked right into it.
The Council is upset I'm the youngest to ever serve.
No, it is not. Anakin, I worry when you speak of jealousy and pride. Those are not Jedi thoughts. They're dangerous, dark thoughts.
Master, you of all people should have confidence in my abilities. I know where my loyalties lie.
I hope so . . .
I sense there's more to this talk than you're saying.
Anakin, the only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.
And?
Anakin, look, I am on your side. I didn't want to see you put in this situation.
What situation?
The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor's dealings. They want to know what he's up to.
They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That's treason!
We are at war, Anakin. The Jedi Council is sworn to uphold the principles of the Republic, even if the Chancellor does not.
Why didn't the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?
This assignment is not to be on record. The Council asked me to approach you on this personally.
The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.
That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.
Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer.
Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place.
You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?
The Council is asking you.
It's very dangerous, putting them together. I don't think the boy can handle it. I don't trust him.
He'll be all right. I trust him with my life.
I wish I did.
With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?
A prophecy . . . that misread could have been.
He will not let me down. He never has.
Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.
Does everyone agree?
He was not so successful the last time he met Grievous. No offense, my Master, but I'm only stating a fact.
Oh no, you're quite right, but I do have the most experience with his ways of combat.
Several times . . . I was so happy to hear he was accepted on the Jedi Council.
I know ... he deserves it. He is impatient, strong willed, very opinionated, but truly gifted.
You're not just here to say hello. Something is wrong, isn't it?
You should be a Jedi, Padme.
You're not very good at hiding your feelings.
It's Anakin . . . He's becoming moody and detached. He's been put in a difficult position as the Chancellor's representative . . . but I think it's more than that. I was hoping he may have talked to you.
Why would he talk to me about his work?
Neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either.
Don't give me that look.
I know how he feels about you.
What did he say?
Nothing. He didn't have to.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I know you both too well. I can see you two are in love. Padme, I'm worried about him. I fear your relationship has confused him. He's changed considerably since we returned . . . Padme, I'm not telling the Council about any of this. I ... I hope I didn't upset you. We're all friends, I care about both of you . . .
Thank you, Obi-Wan.
Please do what you can to help him.
You're going to need me on this one, Master.
Oh, I agree. However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.
Master! Master, I've disappointed you. I have not been very appreciative of your training . . . I have been arrogant and I apologize . . . I've just been so frustrated with the Council. Your friendship means everything to me.
You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be, and you have saved my life more times than I can remember. But be patient, Anakin. It won't be long before the Council makes you a Jedi Master. Don't worry. I have enough clones with me to take three systems the size of Utapau. I think I'll be able to handle the situation . . . even without your help.
Well, there's always a first time. Obi-Wan, may the Force be with you.
Good-bye, old friend. May the Force be with you.
Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here . . . on the far side.
I'll keep them distracted until you get there. Just don't take too long.
Come on, boss, when have I ever let you down?
Cato Nemoidia . . . for starters.
That was Anakin who was late. I believe.
Very well, the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you get there.
I can't!
Don't give up, Padme. Don't give up . . .
Greetings, young Jedi. What brings you to our remote sanctuary?
Unfortunately, the war.
There is no war here unless you've brought it with you.
With your kind permission, I should like some fuel and to use your city as a base as I search nearby systems for General Grievous.
He is here! We are being held hostage. They are watching us.
I understand.
The tenth level . . . thousands of Battle Droids . . .
Tell your people to take shelter. If you have warriors, now is the time. Geenine, take the Fighter back to the ship. I'm staying here. Tell Cody I've made contact.
You need transportation.
Get it for me.
I will get it for you.
This one.
Boga. She answers to Boga.
Good girl, Boga.
General Kenobi, you are a bold one. I find your behavior bewildering . . . Surely you realize you're doomed,  Kill him! Enough of this. Back away. I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.
Your move.
You fool. I have been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku himself. Attack, Kenobi.
You forget I trained the Jedi that defeated Count Dooku! I may not defeat your droids, but my troops certainly will.
Army or not, you must realize you are doomed.
I don't think so.
Very good, sir. Oh, by the way, I think you'll be needing this.
Thank you, Cody,  Now let's get a move on. We've got a battle to win here.
. . . Kenobi . . .
I've locked on. Repeat.
Master Kenobi??
Senator Organa! My Clone Troops turned on me ... I need help.
Master Kenobi, dark times are these. Good to see you. it is.
You were attacked by your Clones, also?
With the help of the Wookiees, barely escape, I did.
How many other Jedi managed to survive?
I saw thousands of troops attack the Jedi Temple. That's why I went looking for Yoda.
Have we had any contact from the Temple?
It requests all Jedi to return to the Temple. It says that the war is over . . .
Well, then we must go back! If there are other stragglers, they will fall into the trap and be killed.
Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?
Yes, Master. There is too much at stake here, and we need a clearer picture of what has happened.
It could be a trap.
No, I don't think so. The Chancellor will not be able to control the thousands of star systems without keeping the Senate intact.
Thank you, you may proceed. We will take custody of the Jedi.
It would be better if we stayed with the Senator.
Killed not by clones, this Padawan. By a lightsaber, he was.
. . .Who?? Who could have done this?
If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.
I must know the truth, Master. It can't be . . . It can't be . . .
Now, Lord Vader, now go and bring peace to the Empire.
I can't watch any more.
Destroy the Sith, we must.
Send me to kill the Emperor. I will not kill Anakin.
To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not.
He is like my brother ... I cannot do it.
Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has become. The boy you trained, gone he is . . . Consumed by Darth Vader.
How could it have come to this?
To question, no time there is.
I do not know where the Emperor has sent him. I don't know where to look.
Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him, you will. Visit the new Emperor, my task is. May the Force be with you.
May the Force be with you, Master Yoda.
Hello, might I help you . . . Oh, it's you, Master Kenobi. Come in, quickly.
Has Anakin been here . . . ?
Master Kenobi . . . Oh, Obi-Wan, thank goodness . . . you're alive.
The Republic has fallen. Padme . . . The Jedi Order is no more . . .
I know, it's hard to believe everything to which we've dedicated our lives is gone.
I believe we have been part of a plot hundreds of years in the making.
The Senate is still intact, there is some hope.
No. Padme . . . It's over . . . The Sith now rule the galaxy as they did before the Republic.
The Sith!?!
I'm here looking for Anakin . . . When was the last time you saw him?
Yesterday.
And do you know where he is now?
No.
Padme, I need your help. He's in grave danger.
From the Sith?
From himself . . . Padme, Anakin has turned to the dark side.
You're wrong! How could you even say that?
I have seen a security hologram of him killing younglings.
Not Anakin! He couldn't!
He was deceived by a lie. We all were. It appears that the Chancellor is behind everything, including the war. Palpatine is the Sith Lord we've been looking for. After the death of Count Dooku, Anakin became his new apprentice.
I don't believe you ... I can't.
Padme, I must find him.
You're going to kill him, aren't you?
He has become a very great threat.
I can't . . .
Anakin is the father, isn't he? I'm so sorry.
NO! Anakin. I swear ... I ...
Let her go, Anakin.
What have you and she been up to?
Let her go!
You turned her against me.
You have done that yourself.
You will not take her from me.
Your anger and your lust for power have already done that. You have allowed this Dark Lord to twist your mind until now . . . until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.
Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan. I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought peace, justice, freedom, and security to my new Empire.
Your new Empire?
Don't make me kill you.
Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic ... to democracy.
If you're not with me, you're my enemy.
Only a Sith Lord deals in absolutes. I will do what I must.
Don't make me destroy you, Master. You're no match for the dark side.
I've heard that before, Anakin . . . but I never thought I'd hear it from you.
I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over . . .
From the Sith!!! Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil.
From the Jedi point of view! From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.
Well, then you are lost!
This is the end for you, My Master. I wish it were otherwise.
It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.
You underestimate my power!
Don't try it. . . . You were the Chosen One! It was said that you would, destroy the Sith, not join them. It was you who would bring balance to the Force, not leave it in Darkness.
I hate you!
You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you.
Medically, she is completely healthy. For reasons we can't explain, we are losing her.
She's dying?
I can't . . .
Save your energy.
Pregnant, she must still appear. Hidden, safe, the children must be kept.
We must take them somewhere the Sith will not sense their presence.
My wife and I will take the girl. We've always talked of adopting a baby girl. She will be loved with us.
And what of the boy?
To Tatooine. To his family, send him.
I will take the child and watch over him. Master Yoda, do you think Anakin's twins will be able to defeat Darth Sidious?
Strong the Force runs, in the Skywalker line. Hope, we can . . . Done, it is. Until the time is right, disappear we will. Master Kenobi, wait a moment. In your solitude on Tatooine, training I have for you.
Training??
An old friend has learned the path to immortality.
Who?
One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force to train me . . . your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.
Qui-Gon? But, how could he accomplish this?
The secret of the Ancient Order of the Whills, he studied. How to commune with him. I will teach you.
I will be able to talk with him?
Obi! Obi! Obi! Mesa sooo smilen to see'en yousa. Wahoooooo!
It's Good to see you, too, Jar Jar.
Lookie... lookie... Oops!... Oh, dear, I'm afraid I've forgotten myself again.
It's a great pleasure to see you again, M'Lady.
It has been far too long Master Kenobi. I'm so glad our paths have crossed again... but I must warn you that I think your presence here is unnecessary.
I'm sure the Jedi Council have their reasons.
Oh Annie, you'll always be that little boy I knew on Tatooine.
Our presence will be invisible, M'Lady.
I don't need more security, I need answers. I want to know who is trying to kill me.
We're here to protect you Senator, not to start an investigation.
We will find out who is trying to kill you Padme, I promise you.
We are not going to exceed our mandate, my young Padawan learner.
I meant in the interest of protecting her, Master, of course.
We are not going through this exercise again, Anakin. You will pay attention to my lead.
Why?
What??!!
Why else do you think we were assigned to her, if not to find the killer? Protection is a job for local security... not Jedi. It's overkill, Master. Investigation is implied in our mandate.
We will do as the Council has instructed, and you will learn your place, young one.
Shesa happy. Happier den mesa see-en her in longo time.
Anakin, you're focusing on the Negative again. Be mindful of your thoughts. She was glad to see us. Now lets check the security here.
Quiet as a tomb. I don't like just waiting here for something to happen to her.
What's going on?
She covered that camera. I don't think she liked me watching her.
What is she thinking?
She programmed Artoo to warn us if there's an intruder.
It's not an intruder I'm worried about. There are many other ways to kill a Senator.
I know, but we also want to catch this assassin. Don't we, Master?
You're using her as bait??
It was her idea... No harm will come to her. I can sense everything going on in that room. Trust me.
It's too risky... and your senses aren't that attuned, young apprentice.
And yours are?
Possibly.
I don't sleep well, anymore.
Because of your mother?
I don't know why I keep dreaming About her now. I haven't seen her since I was little.
Dreams pass in time.
I'd rather dream of Padme. Just Being around her again is... intoxicating.
Mind your thoughts, Anakin, they betray you. You've made a commitment to the Jedi order... a commitment not easily broken... and don't forget she's a politician. They're not to be trusted.
She's not like the others in the Senate, Master.
It's been my experience that Senators are only focused on pleasing those who fund their campaigns... and they are more than willing to forget the niceties of democracy to get those funds.
Not another lecture, Master. Not on the economics of politics.... It's too early in the morning... and besides, you're generalising. The Chancellor doesn't appear to be corrupt.
Palpatine's a politician, I've observed that he is very clever at following the passions and prejudices of the Senators.
I think he is a good man. My instincts are very positive about...
I sense it, too.
That was wacky! I almost lost you in the traffic.
What took you so long?
Oh, you know, Master, I couldn't find a speeder I really liked, with an open cockpit... and with the right speed capabilities... and then you know I had to get a really gonzo color...
If you'd spend as much time working on your saber skills as you do on your wit, young Padawan, you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman.
I thought I already did.
Only in your mind, my very young apprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!!
Sorry, I forgot you don't like flying, Master.
I don't mind flying... but what you're doing is suicide!
Master, you know I've been flying since before I could walk. I'm very good at this.
Just slow down! Wait! Don't go in there! You know I don't like it when you do that!
Sorry, Master. Don't worry, this guy's gonna kill himself any minute now!
What are you doing? He's gonna blast me!
Right - this isn't working.
That was too close!
Clear that!
What??
Clear the flag! We're losing power! Hurry!
Whooooaaa! Don't do that! I don't  like it when you do that!
So sorry, Master.
It's dangerous near those power couplings! Slow down! Don't go through there! Yiiii, what are you doing?
Sorry, Master!
Oh, that was good...
That was crazy!!! Ahh, damn.
Stop!!
No, we can make it.
I'm crazy... I'm crazy... I'm crazy.
But it worked... we made it.
It didn't work... we've stalled! And you almost got us killed!
I think we're still alive.
It was stupid!
I could have made it...
But you didn't!!! And now we've lost him.
No we didn't...
Where are you going?! He went down there, the other way.
This is a shortcut... I think.
What do you mean, 'You think?' What kind of shortcut?! He went completely the other way! You've lost him!
Master, if we keep this chase going, that creep's gonna end up deep fried. Personally, I'd very much like to find out who in the hell he is and who he's working for...
Oh, so that's why we're going in the wrong direction. Well, you lost him.
She went into that club, Master.
Patience. Here. Next time try not to lose it.
Sorry, Master.
A Jedi's saber is his most precious possession.
Yes, Master.
He must keep it with him at all times.
I know, Master.
This weapon is your life!
I've heard this lesson before...
But, you haven't learned anything, Anakin.
Don't say that Master... You're the closest thing I have to a father... I love you. I don't want to cause you pain.
Then why don't you listen to me?!
I will. I'll do better, I promise.
Do you see him him?
I think he's a she...
Then be extra careful... Check it out.
Where are you going, Master?
To get a drink.
Wanna buy some death sticks?
You don't want to sell me death- sticks.
I don't want to sell you death- sticks.
You want to go home and rethink your life.
The Senator from Naboo.
Who hired you?
That Senator's gonna die soon anyway, and the next one won't make the same mistake I did...
This wound's going to need treatment.
It was a Bounty Hunter called...
Toxic Dart...
Then my Jedi protector will have to prove how grown up he is.
Anakin, you stay put on Naboo. Do not attract any attention. Do absolutely nothing without checking in with me or the Council.
Yes, Master.
I will get to the bottom of this plot quickly, M'Lady. You'll be back here in no time.
I know.
May the Force be with you.
There's nothing to worry about... we have Artoo with us.
I hope he doesn't try anything foolish.
Place the subject for analysis on the sensot tray, please.
It's a toxic dart. I need to know where it came from and who made it.
One moment, please. As you can see on your screen, subject weapon does not exist in any known culture. Markings cannot be identified. Probablt self-made by a warrior not associated with any known society.
Excuse me? Could you try again please?
Master Jedi, our records are very thorough. they cover eight percent of the galaxy. If I can't tell you where it came from, nobody can.
Thanks for your assistance! You may not be able to figure this out, but I think I know someone who might.
Can I help ya?
I'm looking for Dexter.
Waddya want him for?
He's not in trouble. It's personal.
Obi-Wan!
Hey, Dex.
You want a cup of ardees?
Thank you.
Hey, ol' buddy!
Hey, Dex.
So, my friend. What can I do for ya?
You can tell me what this is.
Well, whattaya know... I ain't seen one of these since I was prospecting on Subterrel beyond the Outer Rim!
Do you know where it came from?
This baby belongs to them cloners. What you got here is a Kamino Kyberdart.
Kamino Kyberdart... I wonder why it didn't show up in any analysis archive.
It's these funny little cuts on the side give it away... Those analysis droids you've got over there only focus on symbols, you know. I should think you Jedi would have more respect for the difference between knowledge and wisdom.
Well, Dex, if droids could think, we wouldn't be here, would we? Kamino... doesn't sound familiar. Is it part of the Republic?
No, it's beyond the Outer Rim. I'd say about twelve parsecs outside the Rishi Maze, toward the south. It should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archive to find. Those Kaminoans keep to themselves. They're cloners. Damned good ones, too.
Cloners? Are they friendly?
It depends.
On what, Dex?
Did you call for assistance?
Yes... yes, I did...
He has a powerful face, doesn't he? He was one of the most brilliant Jedi I have had the privilege of knowing.
I never understood why he quit. Only twenty Jedi have ever left the Order.
The Lost Twenty... and Count Dooku was the most recent and the most painful. No one likes to talk about it. His leaving was a great loss to the Order.
What happened?
Well, one might say, he was always a bit out of step with the decisions of the Council... much like your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.
Really?
Oh, yes. They were alike in many ways. Very individual thinkers... idealists... He was always striving to become a more powerful Jedi. He wanted to be the best. With a lightsaber, in the old style of fencing, he had no match. His knowledge of the Force was... unique. In the end, I think he left because he lost faith in the Republic. He believed that politics were corrupt, and he felt the Jedi betrayed themselves by serving the politicians. He always had very high expectations of government. He disappeared for nine or ten years, then he just showed up recently as the head of the separatist movement.
Interesting... I'm still not sure I understand.
Well, I'm sure you didn't call me over here for a history lesson. Are you having a problem, Master Kenobi?
Yes, I'm trying to find a planet system called Kamino. It doesn't seem to show upon any of the archive charts.
Kamino? It's not a system I'M familiar with... Let me see... Are you sure you have the right co-ordinates?
According to my information, it should be in this quadrant somewhere... just south of the Rishi Maze.
No co-ordinates? It sounds like the kind of directions you'd get from a street tout... some old miner or Furbog trader.
All three actually.
Are you sure it exists?
Absolutely.
Let me do a gravitational scan. There are some inconsistencies here. Maybe the planet you're looking for was destroyed.
Wouldn't that be on record?
It ought to be. Unless it was very recent. I hate to say it, but it looks like the system you're searching for doesn't exist.
That's impossible... perhaps the archives are incomplete.
Welcome, Master Obi-Wan!
I am sorry to disturb you, Master.
What help to you, can I be?
I'm looking for a planet described to me by an old friend. I trust him. But the system doesn't show up on the archive maps.
An interesting puzzle. Gather round the map reader, younglings. Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet. Find it, we will try...
This is where it ought to be... but it isn't. Gravity is pulling all the stars in this area inward to this spot. There should be a star here... but there isn't.
Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is. Uncluttered. To the centre of the pull of gravity go, and find your planet you will.
But Master Yoda who could have erased information from the archives? That's impossible, isn't it?
Be wary, this disturbance in the Force is growing stronger.
I am concerned for my Padawan. He is not ready to be on his own.
He has exceptional skills. The Council is confident in its decision, Obi-Wan. If the prophecy is true, he weill be the one to bring balance to the Force.
But he still has much to learn. And his abilities have made him... well... arrogant. I realise now what you and Master Yoda knew from the beginning... the boy was too old to start the training and...
There's something else?
Master, he should not have been given this assignment. I'm afraid Anakin won't be able to protect the Senator.
Why?
He has a... an emotional connection with her. It's been there since he was boy. Now he's confused... distracted.
Obi-Wan, you must have faith that he will take the right path.
Has Master Yoda gained any insight into whether or not this war will come about?
Welcome to Tipoca City, Master Jedi. Everything is ready. The Prime Minister expects you.
I'm expected?
May I present Lama Su, Prime Minister of Kamino... and this is Master Jedi...
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Please... I trust you are going to enjoy your stay. We are most happy you have arrived at the best part of the season.
You make me feel most welcome.
And now to business. You will be delighted to hear we are on schedule. Two hundred thousand units are ready, with another million well on the way.
That is... good news.
Please tell your Master Sido-Dyas that we have every confidence his order will be met on time and in full. He is well, I hope?
I'm sorry Master - ?
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas. He's still a leading member of the Jedi Council, is he not?
Oh, yes. Sido-Dyas.
You must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself.
That's why I'm here.
A bounty hunter called Jango Fett. We felt a Jedi would be the perfect choice, but Sido-Dyas hand- picked Jango Fett himself.
Where is this bounty hunter now?
Apart from his pay, which is considerable, Fett demanded only one thing - an unaltered clone for himself. Curious isn't it?
Unaltered?
Pure genetic replication. No tampering with the structure to make it more docile... and no growth acceleration...
I would like to meet this Jango Fett.
Oh yes, it's essential. Otherwise, a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow. Now, we can do it in half the time. Those items you saw on the parade ground were started ten years ago, when Sido-dyas first placed the order, and they're already mature...
And these?
They're immensely superior to droids, capable of independent thought and action.
Very impressive.
I'd hoped you would be pleased.
Tell me, prime minister, when my Master Sido-dyas first contacted you, did he say the order was for... himself... or?
Himself? Of course not. This army is for the Republic?
The Repubic?
I have arranged for you to meet Jango Fett in the morning. Sleep well.
Arfour, Arfour...
No. Whoever placed that order was not a Jedi, I can assure you.
I have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter is the assassin we're looking for.
Who he is working for... discover that, you must.
I will, Master, and I will also find out more about this clone army... May The Force...
That right?
Your clones are very impressive. You must be very proud.
I'm just a simple man, trying to make my way in the universe, Master Jedi.
Aren't we all? Ever made your way as far into the interior as Coruscant?
Once or twice.
Recently?
Possibly...
Then you must know Master Sido- Dyas?
Boba, close the door. Master who?
Sido-Dyas. Isn't he the Jedi who hired you for this job?
Never heard of him. I was recuited by a man called Darth Tyranus on one of the moons of Bogden.
No? I thought...
Sido-Dyas told us to expect him. And he showed up just when your Jedi Master said he would. We have kept the Jedi's involvement a secret until your arrival, just as your Master requested.
Curious...
Do you like your army?
It seems to me it's your army - being that they are all clones of you.
They'll do their job well, I'll guarantee that.
I look forward to seeing them in action. Thank you for your time, Jango.
Tell your Council the first battalions are ready. And remind them that if they need more troops, we will need time to grow them.
I won't forget.
That's outrageous! The treaty forbids the Trade Federation from building up an army. What are they doing?!
The droid foundry seems to be working at full capacity. I am going to go down and investigate. I will bring Jango Fett back home for interrogation.
Those Geonosian foundries are part of the Techno Union. We will call in their representatives and ask them a few very pointed questions.
One more thing. Jango mentioned he was recruited by someone named Darth Tyranus. Any idea who that might be?
Our missing apprentice. They are playing their hand at last.
Do you believe he could be the mysterious Sido-Dyas, who made the deal for the clone army?
Be careful, Obi-Wan. This investigation is becoming less than routine. Do you need help?
Let me see if I can figure out what's going on first.
I retransmitted it as you requested, Master. Then we decided to come and rescue you.
It looks like you're going a good job so far.
I have a bad feeling about this.
Take the one the left. I'll take the one on the right.
What about Padme?
It looks like she's already on top of things.
It's Dooku, go after him! Padme!!! Put the ship down! Down!
No! Forget her. We have to go after Dooku.
No we're not!! Land this ship!
Don't let your personal feelings get in the way. We've got a job to do.
I don't care!.. Go back.
Anakin! She's all right! Look. Follow that speeder!
That won't be necessary, Captain. Stand down. And leave them to me.
We move in together - you slowly on the...
I'm taking him now!
Anakin, no!
Kenobi, isn't it? As you can see, my Jedi powers are far beyond yours. Now, back down.
I don't think so.
Ah, but if I must. I have spent the last ten years learning to use the power of the Dark Side. It gives me infinitely greater power.
You will have to prove it.
Don't bet on it!
Anakin!
Where is your apprentice?
On his way back to Naboo. He is escorting Senator Amidala home. I must admit without the clones, it would not have been a victory.
What happened?
Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day.  You're fortunate you're still in one piece.
Ben?  Ben Kenobi!  Boy, am I glad to see you!
The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly.  Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far?
Oh, this little droid!  I think he's searching for his former master ...  I've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems to be no stopping him.  He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about?
Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan?  Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time.
I think my uncle knew him.  He said he was dead.
Oh, he's not dead, no... not yet.
You know him!
Well of course, of course I know him.  He's me!  I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.
Then the droid does belong to you.
Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid.  Very interesting... I think we better get indoors. The Sand People are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.
No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that?
Quickly, son... they're on the move.
No, my father didn't fight in the wars.  He was a navigator on a spice freighter.
That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals.  Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.
You fought in the Clone Wars?
Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.
I wish I'd known him.
He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.  And he was a good friend.  Which reminds me... I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.
Sure, go ahead. What is it?
Your fathers lightsaber.  This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster. An elegant weapon for a more civilized time.  For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.  Before the dark times, before the Empire.
How did my father die?
A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.  He betrayed and murdered your father.  Now the Jedi are all but extinct.  Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.
The Force?
Well, the Force is what gives the Jedi his power.  It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend.  And where you come from.
I saw part of the message he was...
I seem to have found it.
General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.  Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.  I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.  I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit.  My father will know how to retrieve it.  You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.  This is our most desperate hour.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.
You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.
Alderaan?  I'm not going to Alderaan.  I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.
I need your help, Luke.  I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. She needs your help.
I can't get involved!  I've got work to do!  It's not that I like the Empire.  I hate it!  But there's nothing I can do about it right now.  It's such a long way from here.
That's your uncle talking.
Oh, God, my uncle.  How am I ever going to explain this?
Learn about the Force, Luke.
Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.  You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
You must do what you feel is right, of course.
It looks like Sand People did this, all right.  Look, here are gaffi sticks, bantha tracks.  It's just... I never heard of them hitting anything this big before.
They didn't.  But we are meant to think they did.  These tracks are side by side.  Sand People always ride single file to hide there numbers.
These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.
And these blast points, too accurate for Sand People.  Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas? If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to.  And that would lead them back home!
Wait, Luke!  It's too dangerous.
About three or four seasons.
They're for sale if you want them.
Let me see your identification.
You don't need to see his identification.
We don't need to see his identification.
These are not the droids youÕre looking for.
These are not the droids we're looking for.
He can go about his business.
You can go about your business.
Move along.
Go on, go on.  I can't understand how we got by those troopers.  I thought we were dead.
The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.  You will find it a powerful ally.
Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?
Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here.  Only watch your step.  This place can be a little rough.
You'll be dead.
This little one isn't worth the effort.  Come let me buy you something...
No blasters!  No blaster!
This is Chewbacca.  He's first- mate on a ship that might suit our needs.
Han Solo.  I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.  Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.
Yes, indeed.  If it's a fast ship.
Fast ship?  You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?
Should I have?
It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs! I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.  I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.  She's fast enough for you, old man.  What's the cargo?
Only passengers.  Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked.
What is it?  Some kind of local trouble?
Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.
You bet I could.  I'm not such a bad pilot myself!  We don't have to sit here and listen...
We haven't that much with us. But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.
Seventeen, huh! Okay.  You guys got yourself a ship.  We'll leave as soon as you're ready.  Docking bay Ninety-four.
Ninety-four.
He says it's the best he can do. Since the XP-38 came out, they just arenÕt in demand.
It will be enough. If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.
Here's where the fun begins!
How long before you can make the jump to light speed?
Are you all right?  What's wrong?
I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.  I fear something terrible has happened. You'd better get on with your exercises.
I see your point, sir.  I suggest a new strategy, Artoo.  Let the Wookiee win.
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.
You mean it controls your actions?
Partially. But it also obeys your commands.
Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.  I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.
With the blast shield down, I can't even see.  How am I supposed to fight?
Your eyes can deceive you.  Don't trust them. Stretch out with your feelings. You see, you can do it.
I call it luck.
In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.
You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote.
That's good.  You have taken your first step into a larger world.
What?  How?
Destroyed... by the Empire!
Maybe they know what happened.
It's an Imperial fighter.
It followed us!
No.  It's a short range fighter.
Not if I can help it.  Chewie... jam it's transmissions.
It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range.
I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.
That's no moon!  It's a space station.
I have a very bad feeling about this.
Turn the ship around!
There's nothin' I can do about it, kid.  I'm in full power.  I'm going to have to shut down.  But they're not going to get me without a fight!
You can't win.  But there are alternatives to fighting.
I use them for smuggling.  I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them.  This is ridiculous.  Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam.
Leave that to me!
Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!
Who's the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him?
We found the computer outlet, sir.
Plug in.  He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.
He says he's found the main control to the power beam that's holding the ship here.  He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor. The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.
I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone.
I want to go with you.
Be patient, Luke.  Stay and watch over the droids.
But he can...
They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.  Your destiny lies along a different path from mine.  The Force will be with you ... always!
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last.  The circle is now complete. When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master.
Only a master of evil, Darth.
Your powers are weak, old man.
You can't win, Darth.  If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
Blast the door!  Kid!
Run, Luke!  Run!
Hang on tight, Artoo, you've got to come back. You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?
Luke, the Force will be with you.
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.
Yoda will always be with you.
Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me? You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.
A certain point of view!
Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. I don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it certainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened to your father was my fault. Anakin was a good friend. When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him.  I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi.  I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda.  I was wrong.  My pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy.
There's still good in him.
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
I can't do it, Ben.
You cannot escape your destiny.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke...but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience.  Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
But I had to help my friends.
And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved little by rushing back prematurely, I fear.
I found out Darth Vader was my father.
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
I can't kill my own father.
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
Yoda spoke of another.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
But I have no sister.
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
Leia! Leia's my sister.
Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor. When your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your mother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible.  So I took you to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan. The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew she'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power, since Alderaan had long been a democracy.  Even so, the family continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster father's path, became a senator as well.  That's not all she became, of course... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause.  That's what she was doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became desperate.
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke ... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!
Ben?
You will go to the Dagobah system.
Dagobah system?
There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me.
I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience.
He will learn patience.
Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father.
Was I any different when you taught me?
Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. (to the invisible Ben, indicating Luke) This one a long time have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. (turning to Luke) You are reckless!
So was I, if you'll remember.
But Han and Leia will die if I don't.
You don't know that. Even Yoda cannot see their fate.
But I can help them! I feel the Force!
But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force.
But I've learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to return and finish what I've begun. You have my word.
It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. that is why your friends are made to suffer.
And that is why I have to go.
Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost Vader.
Stopped they must be. On this depends. Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil.
Patience.
If you honor what they fight for...yes!
If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot interfere.
I understand.  Artoo, fire up the converters.
Luke, don't give in to hate -- that leads to the dark side.
Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse.
That boy is our last hope.
