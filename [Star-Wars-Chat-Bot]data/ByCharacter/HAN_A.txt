fast ship  you are never heard of the millennium falcon
it will the ship that made the kessel run in less than twelve parsecs i are outrun imperial starships not the local bulkcruisers mind you  ilet us talking about the big corellian ships now  she will fast enough for you old man  what will the cargo
what is it  some kind of local trouble
well that will the real trick iscan not it  and it will going to cost you something extra  ten thousand in advance
but who will going to fly it kid you
seventeen huh okay  you guys got yourself a ship  we have leave as soon as you am ready  docking bay ninetyfour
looks like somebody will beginning to take an interest in your handiwork
seventeen thousand  those guys must really be desperate  this could really save my neck  get back to the ship and get her ready
yes greedo  as a matter of fact i was just going to see your boss tell jabba that i are got his money
yeah but this time i got the money
i docan not have it with me  tell jabba 
even i get boarded sometimes  do you think i had a choice
over my dead body
yes i have bet you have sorry about the mess
i are been waiting for you jabba
ilet us not the type to run
you sent greedo to blast me
i think he thought he was  next time docan not send one of those twerps if you are got something to say to me come see me yourself
you know even i get boarded sometimes jabba  i had no choice but i are got a charter now and i can pay you back plus a little extra  i just need some more time
jabba i have pay you because it will my pleasure
she have make point five beyond the speed of light  she may not look like much but she will got it where it counts kid  i are added some special modifications myself we am a little rushed so if you have hurry aboard we have get out of here
watch your mouth kid or you am going to find yourself floating home  we have be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace besides i know a few maneuvers we have lose them
it have take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi computer
traveling through hyperspace iscan not like dusting crops boy  without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that is end your trip real quick wouldcan not it
we am losing our deflector shield go strap yourself in ilet us going to make the jump to light speed
well you can forget your troubles with those imperial slugs  i told you i is outrun  not docan not everyone thank me at once anyway we should be at alderaan about ohtwohundred hours
let him have it it will not wise to upset a wookiee
that will  cause droids docan not pull people will arms out of their socket when they lose  wookiees are known to do that
hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side kid
kid i are flown from one side of this galaxy to the other  i are seen a lot of strange stuff but i are never seen anything to make me believe there will one allpowerful force controlling everything there will no mystical energy field that controls my destiny it will all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense
i call it luck
look going good against remotes is one thing  going good against the living  that will something else looks like we am coming up on alderaan
our position is correct except  no alderaan
thats what ilet us trying to tell you kid  it aican not there  it will been totally blown away
the entire starfleet couldcan not destroy the whole planet  it is take a thousand ships with more fire power than i are  there will another ship coming in
there arecan not any bases around here  where did it come from
not if i can help it  chewie  jam it will transmissions
not for long 
well he aican not going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us
i think i can get him before he gets there  he will almost in range
it will too big to be a space station
yeah i think your right  full reverse  chewie lock in the auxiliary power
we am caught in a tractor beam it will pulling us in
there will nothin  i can do about it kid  ilet us in full power  ilet us going to have to shut down  but they am not going to get me without a fight
i use them for smuggling  i never thought i is be smuggling myself in them  this is ridiculous  even if i could take off i is never get past the tractor beam
damn fool i knew that you were going to say that
hey down there could you give us a hand with this
bring them on  i prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around
whatever you say  i are done more than i bargained for on this trip already
boy you said it chewie where did you dig up that old fossil
yeah great at getting us into trouble
well anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for them to pick us up
