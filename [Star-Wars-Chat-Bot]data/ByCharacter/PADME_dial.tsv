BAIL ORGANA	Certainly.
PADME	Oh, Anakin! Thank goodness, you're back.
ANAKIN	I missed you, Padme. I've missed you so.
PADME	There were whispers . . . that you'd been killed. I've been living with unbearable dread.
ANAKIN	I'm back, I'm all right. It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been ... If the Chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges.
PADME	Wait, not here . . .
ANAKIN	Yes, here! I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they know we're married.
PADME	Anakin, don't say things like that. You're important to the Republic ... to ending this war. I love you more than anything, but I won't let you give up your life as a Jedi for me . . .
ANAKIN	I've given my life to the Jedi order, but I'd only give up my life, for you.
PADME	I wouldn't like that. I wouldn't like that one bit. Patience, my handsome Jedi . . . Come to me later.
ANAKIN	Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on?
PADME	I'm just excited to see you.
ANAKIN	That's not it. I sense more . . . what is it?
PADME	Nothing . . . nothing . . .
ANAKIN	You're frightened.  Tell me what's going on!
PADME	You've been gone five months . . . it's been very hard for me. I've never felt so alone. There's . . .
ANAKIN	. . . Is there someone else?
PADME	No! Why do you think that? Your jealousy upsets me so much, Anakin. I do nothing to betray you, yet you still don't trust me. Nothing has changed.
ANAKIN	I'm afraid of losing you, Padme . . . that's all.
PADME	I will never stop loving you, Anakin. My only fear is losing you.
ANAKIN	It's just that I've never seen you like this . . .
PADME	Something wonderful has happened. I'm . . . Annie, I'm pregnant.
ANAKIN	That's . . . that's wonderful.
PADME	What are we going to do?
===	===
ANAKIN	. . . every second I was thinking of you. Protecting the endless, nameless Outer Rim settlements became a torture . . . the battles were easy, the longing became unbearable . . . I've never been so happy as I am at this moment.
PADME	Annie, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We could go to the lake country where no one would know . . . where we would be safe. I could go early-and fix up the baby's room. I know the perfect spot, right by the gardens.
ANAKIN	You are so beautiful!
PADME	It's only because I'm so in love . . .
ANAKIN	No, it's because I'm so in love with you.
PADME	So love has blinded you?
ANAKIN	Well, that's not exactly what I meant . . .
PADME	But it's probably true!
ANAKIN	I haven't laughed in so long . . .
PADME	Neither have I.
===	===
ANAKIN	Nothing . . . I remember when I gave this to you.
PADME	Anakin, how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other?
ANAKIN	It was a dream.
PADME	Bad?
ANAKIN	Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died.
PADME	And?
ANAKIN	It was about you.
PADME	Tell me.
ANAKIN	It was only a dream. You die in childbirth . . .
PADME	And the baby?
ANAKIN	I don't know.
PADME	It was only a dream.
ANAKIN	. . . I won't let this one become real, Padme.
PADME	Anakin, this baby will change our lives. I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate, and if the Council discovers you are the father, you will be expelled from the Jedi Order.
ANAKIN	I know бн.
PADME	Anakin, do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?
ANAKIN	Have you told him anything?
PADME	No, but he's your mentor, your best friend . . . he must suspect something.
ANAKIN	He's been a father to me, but he's still on the Council. Don't tell him anything!
PADME	I won't, Anakin.
===	===
BAIL ORGANA	The decree was posted this morning.
PADME	Do you think he will dismantle the Senate?
BAIL ORGANA	It has become increasingly clear to many of us that the Chancellor has become an enemy of democracy.
PADME	I can't believe it has come to this! Chancellor Palpatine is one of my oldest advisors. He served as my Ambassador when I was Queen.
BAIL ORGANA	We can't sit around debating any longer, we have decided to do what we can to stop it. Senator Mon Mothma and I are putting together an organization . . .
PADME	Say no more. Senator Organa. I understand. At this point, it's better to leave some things unsaid.
MON MOTHMA	That means those closest to you . . . even family ... no one can be told.
PADME	Agreed.
===	===
CAPTAIN TYPHO	Rest well. My Lady.
PADME	I'll be up in a while.
C-3PO	Is there anything I might do for you, my lady?
PADME	Yes, make sure all the security droids are working. Thank you, Threepio.
ANAKIN	Beautiful, isn't it?
PADME	You startled me.
ANAKIN	How are you feeling?
PADME	He keeps kicking.
ANAKIN	He?! Why do you think it's a boy?
PADME	My motherly intuition.
ANAKIN	Whoa! With a kick that strong, it's got to be a girl.
PADME	I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I'm so proud of you.
ANAKIN	I may be on the Council, but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master.
PADME	Patience. In time, they will recognize your skills.
ANAKIN	They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power, that's the problem.
PADME	Anakin . . .
ANAKIN	Sometimes, I wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.
PADME	Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?
ANAKIN	What do you mean?
PADME	What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?
ANAKIN	I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a Separatist!
PADME	Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.
ANAKIN	Don't ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I'm not your errand boy. I'm not anyone's errand boy!
PADME	What is it?
ANAKIN	Nothing.
PADME	Don't do this . . . don't shut me out. Let me help you.
ANAKIN	You can't help me . . . I'm trying to help you. I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me.
PADME	I sense there are things you are not telling me. Hold me . . . like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long ago . . . when there was nothing but our love ... No politics, no plotting ... no war.
===	===
OBI-WAN	Has Anakin been to see you?
PADME	Several times . . . I was so happy to hear he was accepted on the Jedi Council.
OBI-WAN	I know ... he deserves it. He is impatient, strong willed, very opinionated, but truly gifted.
PADME	You're not just here to say hello. Something is wrong, isn't it?
OBI-WAN	You should be a Jedi, Padme.
PADME	You're not very good at hiding your feelings.
OBI-WAN	It's Anakin . . . He's becoming moody and detached. He's been put in a difficult position as the Chancellor's representative . . . but I think it's more than that. I was hoping he may have talked to you.
PADME	Why would he talk to me about his work?
OBI-WAN	Neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either.
PADME	Don't give me that look.
OBI-WAN	I know how he feels about you.
PADME	What did he say?
OBI-WAN	Nothing. He didn't have to.
PADME	I don't know what you're talking about.
OBI-WAN	I know you both too well. I can see you two are in love. Padme, I'm worried about him. I fear your relationship has confused him. He's changed considerably since we returned . . . Padme, I'm not telling the Council about any of this. I ... I hope I didn't upset you. We're all friends, I care about both of you . . .
PADME	Thank you, Obi-Wan.
===	===
MON MOTHMA	We are hoping to form an alliance in the Senate to stop the Chancellor from further subverting the constitution, that's all.
PADME	I know a Jedi I feel it would be wise to consult.
MON MOTHMA	We don't know where the Jedi stand in all this.
PADME	I only wish to discuss this with one . . . one I trust.
GIDDEAN DANU	Going against the Chancellor without the support of the Jedi is risky.
PADME	The Jedi aren't any happier with the situation than we are . . .
===	===
OBI-WAN	Save your energy.
PADME	I can't!
===	===
ANAKIN	I sense someone familiar . . . Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?
PADME	He came by this morning.
ANAKIN	What did he want?
PADME	He's worried about you.
ANAKIN	You told him about us, didn't you?
PADME	He's your best friend, Anakin. He says you're under a lot of stress.
ANAKIN	And he's not?
PADME	You have been moody lately.
ANAKIN	I'm not moody . . .
PADME	Anakin! Don't do this again.
ANAKIN	I don't know ... I feel . . . lost.
PADME	Lost? What do you mean? You're always so sure of yourself. I don't understand.
ANAKIN	Obi-Wan and the Council don't trust me.
PADME	They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan loves you as a son.
ANAKIN	Something's happening . . . I'm not the Jedi I should be. I am one of the most powerful Jedi, but I'm not satisfied ... I want more, and I know I shouldn't.
PADME	You expect too much of yourself.
ANAKIN	I have found a way to save you.
PADME	Save me?
ANAKIN	From my nightmares.
PADME	Is that what's bothering you?
ANAKIN	I won't lose you, Padme.
PADME	I'm not going to die in childbirth, Annie. I promise you.
ANAKIN	No, I promise you! I am becoming so powerful with my new knowledge of the Force, I will be able to keep you from dying.
PADME	You don't need more power, Anakin. I believe you can protect me against anything, just as you are.
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	I understand your reservations completely, Senator, and I assure you the appointment of Governors will in no way compete with the duties of the Senate.
PADME	May I take it then, that there will be no further amendments to the Constitution?
DARTH SIDIOUS	I want this terrible conflict to end as much as you do, My Lady, and when it does I guarantee an immediate return to democracy . . .
PADME	You are pursuing a diplomatic solution to the war, then.
DARTH SIDIOUS	I have said I will do what is right, that should be enough for your . . . committee.
PADME	"On behalf of the ""delegation of two thousand,"" I thank you, Chancellor."
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	You do know, don't you, if the Jedi destroy me, any chance of saving her will be lost.
PADME	I truly, deeply love you. Before I die. I want you to know.
===	===
C-3PO	Hush! Not so loud!
PADME	Are you all right? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi Temple . . . you can see the smoke from here.
ANAKIN	I'm fine. I'm fine. I came to see if you and the baby are safe.
PADME	Captain Typho's here, we're safe. What's happening?
ANAKIN	The situation is not good. The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic . . .
PADME	I can't believe that!
C-3PO	Something important is going on! I heard a rumor they are going to banish all droids. Shhhhhh . . . not so loud. Whatever it is, we'll be the last to know.
PADME	Anakin, what are you going to do?
ANAKIN	I will not betray the Republic . . . my loyalties lie with the Chancellor and with the Senate . . . and with you.
PADME	What about Obi-Wan?
ANAKIN	I don't know . . . Many Jedi have been killed. We can only hope that he's remained loyal to the Chancellor.
PADME	How could this have happened?
ANAKIN	The Republic is unstable, Padme. The Jedi aren't the only ones trying to take advantage of the situation. There are also traitors in the Senate.
PADME	What are you saying?
ANAKIN	You need to distance yourself from your friends in the Senate. The Chancellor said they will be dealt with when this conflict is over.
PADME	What if they start an inquisition? I've opposed this war. What will you do if I become a suspect?
ANAKIN	That won't happen. I won't let it.
PADME	Oh, Anakin, I'm afraid.
ANAKIN	Have faith, my love. Everything will soon be set right. The Chancellor has given me a very important mission. The Separatists have gathered in the Mustafar system. I'm going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return . . . things will be different, I promise. Please, wait for me.
PADME	I will.
C-3PO	Well, he is under a lot of stress, Artoo. Take care, my little friend. My Lady, is there anything I might do?
PADME	No thank you, Threepio.
G-3PO	A snack, perhaps?
PADME	No.
===	===
BAIL ORGANA	I was held up. What's happening?
PADME	The Chancellor has been elaborating on a plot by the Jedi, to overthrow the Senate.
BAIL ORGANA	That's not true!
PADME	He's been presenting evidence all afternoon.
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	The war is over.  The Separatists have been defeated,  and the Jedi rebellion has been foiled. We stand on the threshold of a new beginning.
PADME	Well, this is the moment we discover if he intends to return the Republic to a democracy.
DARTH SIDIOUS	In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society which I assure you will last for ten thousand years. An empire that will continue to be ruled by this august body, and a sovereign ruler chosen for life . . . An empire ruled by the majority . . . Ruled by a new constitution . . .
PADME	So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause . . .
BAIL ORGANA	We cannot let this happen.
PADME	Not now! There will be a time.
===	===
C-3PO	Yes . . . right after the attack on the Jedi Temple.
PADME	Master Kenobi . . . Oh, Obi-Wan, thank goodness . . . you're alive.
OBI-WAN	The Republic has fallen. Padme . . . The Jedi Order is no more . . .
PADME	I know, it's hard to believe everything to which we've dedicated our lives is gone.
OBI-WAN	I believe we have been part of a plot hundreds of years in the making.
PADME	The Senate is still intact, there is some hope.
OBI-WAN	No. Padme . . . It's over . . . The Sith now rule the galaxy as they did before the Republic.
PADME	The Sith!?!
OBI-WAN	I'm here looking for Anakin . . . When was the last time you saw him?
PADME	Yesterday.
OBI-WAN	And do you know where he is now?
PADME	No.
OBI-WAN	Padme, I need your help. He's in grave danger.
PADME	From the Sith?
OBI-WAN	From himself . . . Padme, Anakin has turned to the dark side.
PADME	You're wrong! How could you even say that?
OBI-WAN	I have seen a security hologram of him killing younglings.
PADME	Not Anakin! He couldn't!
OBI-WAN	He was deceived by a lie. We all were. It appears that the Chancellor is behind everything, including the war. Palpatine is the Sith Lord we've been looking for. After the death of Count Dooku, Anakin became his new apprentice.
PADME	I don't believe you ... I can't.
OBI-WAN	Padme, I must find him.
PADME	You're going to kill him, aren't you?
OBI-WAN	He has become a very great threat.
PADME	I can't . . .
===	===
CAPTAIN TYPHO	My Lady, let me come with you.
PADME	There is no danger. The fighting is over, and . . . this is personal.
CAPTAIN TYPHO	As you wish, My Lady . . . but I strongly disagree.
PADME	I'll be all right, Captain. This is something I must do myself. Besides, Threepio will look after me.
===	===
ANAKIN	Padme, I saw your ship . . .
PADME	Oh, Anakin!
ANAKIN	It's all right, you're safe now. What are you doing out here?
PADME	I was so worried about you. Obi-Wan told me terrible things.
ANAKIN	What things?
PADME	He said you have turned to the dark side . . . that you killed younglings.
ANAKIN	Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.
PADME	He cares about us.
ANAKIN	Us??!
PADME	He knows . . . He wants to help you.
ANAKIN	Is Obi-Wan going to protect you? He can't ... he can't help you. He's not strong enough.
PADME	Anakin, all I want is your love.
ANAKIN	Love won't save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that.
PADME	At what cost? You are a good person. Don't do this.
ANAKIN	I won't lose you the way I lost my mother! I've become more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of and I've done it for you. To protect you.
PADME	Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else behind while we still can.
ANAKIN	Don't you see, we don't have to run away anymore. I have brought peace to the Republic. I am more powerful than the Chancellor. I can overthrow him, and together you and I can rule the galaxy. Make things the way we want them to be.
PADME	I don't believe what I'm hearing . . . Obi-Wan was right. You've changed.
ANAKIN	I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me. Don't you turn against me.
PADME	I don't know you anymore. Anakin, you're breaking my heart. I'll never stop loving you, but you are going down a path I
ANAKIN	Because of Obi-Wan?
PADME	Because of what you've done . . . what you plan to do. Stop, stop now. Come back! I love you.
ANAKIN	Liar!
PADME	No!
ANAKIN	You're with him. You've betrayed me! You brought him here to kill me!
PADME	NO! Anakin. I swear ... I ...
===	===
MEDICAL DROID	It's a boy.
PADME	Luke . . .
MEDICAL DROID	... and a girl.
PADME	. . . Leia.
===	===
OBI-WAN	You have twins, Padme They need you . . . hang on.
PADME	I can't . . .
OBI-WAN	Save your energy.
PADME	Obi-Wan . . . there . . . is good in him. I know there is ... still . . .
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	It is with great surprise and joy the chair recognises the Senator from Naboo, Padme Amidala.
PADME	Less than an hour ago, an assassination attempt was made against my life. One of my bodyguards and six  others were ruthlessly and senselessly murdered. I was the target but, more importantly, I believe this security measure before you, was the target. I have led the opposition to build an army... but there is someone in this body who will stop at nothing to assure it's passage... I warn you, if you vote to create this army, war will follow. I have experienced the misery of war first-hand; I do not wish to do it again. Wake up, Senators... you must wake up! If you offer the separatists violence, they can only show us violence in return! Many will lose their lives. All will lose their freedom. This decision could very well destroy the very foundation of our great Republic. I pray you do not let fear push you into a disastrous decision. Vote down this security measure, which is nothing less than a declaration of war! Does anyone here want that? I cannot believe they do.
===	===
YODA	With you the force is strong... young Senator. To see you alive brings warm feeling to my heart.
PADME	Thank you, Master Yoda. Do you have any idea who was behind the attack?
MACE WINDU	Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners, on the moons of Naboo.
PADME	I don't wish to disagree but I think that Count Dooku was behind it.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Count Dooku has always avoided any kind of conflict. It appears he has no desire to start a war. Why would he kill you? To what end?
PADME	I don't know, but everything in my being tells me he was behind it...
BAIL ORGANA	Do you think that is a wise use of manpower during these stressful times?
PADME	Chancellor, if I may comment, I do not believe the...
DARTH SIDIOUS	"...""situation is that serious."" No, but I do, Senator."
PADME	Chancellor, please! I don't want any more guards!
DARTH SIDIOUS	You must remember him, M'Lady... he watched over you during the blockade conflict.
PADME	This is not necessary, Chancellor.
===	===
OBI-WAN	It's a great pleasure to see you again, M'Lady.
PADME	It has been far too long Master Kenobi. I'm so glad our paths have crossed again... but I must warn you that I think your presence here is unnecessary.
OBI-WAN	I'm sure the Jedi Council have their reasons.
PADME	Annie?? My goodness you've grown.
ANAKIN	So have you... grown more beautiful, I mean... and much shorter... for a Senator, I mean.
PADME	Oh Annie, you'll always be that little boy I knew on Tatooine.
CAPTAIN TYPHO	I am very grateful you are here, Master Kenobi. The situation is more dangerous than the Senator will admit.
PADME	I don't need more security, I need answers. I want to know who is trying to kill me.
OBI-WAN	We will do as the Council has instructed, and you will learn your place, young one.
PADME	Perhaps with merely your presence, the mysteries surrounding this threat will be revealed.  Now if you will excuse me I will retire.
===	===
JAR JAR	Yousa betchen mesa bottums.
PADME	What?!
JAR JAR	Oh, pardone-ay, Senator. I mean, I am honoured to accept this heavy burden. I take on this responsibility with deep humility tinged with an overwhelming pride. It is not every day that I am called upon to...
PADME	You're a good friend, Jar Jar. I don't wish to hold you up. I'm sure you have a great deal to do.
JAR JAR	Of course, M'lady.
PADME	I do not like this idea of hiding.
ANAKIN	Don't worry. Now that the Council has ordered an investigation, it won't take Master Obi-Wan long to find that bounty hunter.
PADME	"I haven't worked for a year to defeat the ""Military Creation Act"" not to be here when its fate is decided."
ANAKIN	Sometimes we have to let go of our pride and do what is requested of us.
PADME	Pride?!? Annie, you're young, and you don't have a very firm grip on politics. I suggest you reserve your opinions for some other time.
ANAKIN	Sorry, M'lady. I was only trying to...
PADME	Annie! No!
ANAKIN	Please don't call me that.
PADME	What?
ANAKIN	Annie...
PADME	I've always called you that... it is your name, isn't it?
ANAKIN	It's Anakin. When you say Annie it's like I'm still a little boy... and I'm not.
PADME	I'm sorry, Anakin. It's impossible to deny you've... ...that you've grown up.
ANAKIN	Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it...
PADME	Mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like. It's the only way we grow.
ANAKIN	Don't get me wrong... Obi-Wan is a great mentor. As wise as Master Yoda and as powerful as Master Windu. I am truly thankful to be his apprentice. Only... although I'm a Padawan learner, in some ways... a lot of ways... I'm ahead of him. I'm ready for the trials. I know I am! He knows it too. He believes I'm too unpredictable... Other Jedi my age have gone through the trials and made it... I know I started my training late... but he won't let me move on.
PADME	That must be frustrating.
ANAKIN	It's worse... he's overly critical. He never listens! He just doesn't understand! It's not fair!
PADME	I'm sorry... You sounded exactly like that little boy I once knew, when he didn't get his way.
ANAKIN	I'm not whining! I'm not.
PADME	I didn't say it to hurt you.
ANAKIN	I know...
PADME	Anakin... Don't try to grow up too fast.
ANAKIN	I am grown up. You said it yourself.
PADME	Please don't look at me like that.
ANAKIN	Why not?
PADME	Because I can see what you're thinking.
ANAKIN	Ahh... so, you have Jedi powers too?
PADME	It makes me feel uncomfortable.
===	===
CAPTAIN TYPHO	Be safe, m'lady.
PADME	Thank you, Captain. Take good care of Dorme... the threat's on you two now.
DORME	He'll be safe with me.
PADME	You'll be fine.
DORME	It's not me, M'Lady. I worry about you. What if they realise I'm not you?
PADME	Then my Jedi protector will have to prove how grown up he is.
OBI-WAN	I will get to the bottom of this plot quickly, M'Lady. You'll be back here in no time.
PADME	I will be most grateful for your speed, Master Jedi.
ANAKIN	Time to go.
PADME	I know.
ANAKIN	May the Force be with you, Master.
PADME	Suddenly, I'm afraid...
ANAKIN	I'm kinda scared too. This is my first assignment on my own.
PADME	There's nothing to worry about... we have Artoo with us.
===	===
ANAKIN	No, no, Mom, no... What?
PADME	You seemed to be having a nightmare. Are you hungry?
ANAKIN	Thank you.
PADME	We went into lightspeed a while ago.
ANAKIN	I look forward to seeing Naboo again. I've thought about it every day since I left. It's by far the most beautiful place I've ever seen...
PADME	You were just a little boy then. It may not be as you remember it; time changes your perception.
ANAKIN	I think time has given me much more mature feelings to enhance my perception.
PADME	It must be difficult having sworn your life to the Jedi... not being able to visit the places you like... or do the things you like...
ANAKIN	Or be with the people I love.
PADME	Are you allowed to love? I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.
ANAKIN	Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love, is central to a Jedi's life, so you might say we're encouraged to love.
PADME	You have changed so much
ANAKIN	You haven't changed a bit. You're exactly the way I remember you in my dreams. I doubt if Naboo has changed much either.
PADME	It hasn't...
ANAKIN	I can't wait to breathe the sweet breeze that comes off the rolling hills. Whenever I try to visualise the Force, those hills are what I see. I love Naboo.
PADME	Were you dreaming about you mother earlier, weren't you?
===	===
ANAKIN	If I grew up here, I don't think I'd ever leave.
PADME	I doubt that.
ANAKIN	No, really. When I started my training, I was very homesick and very lonely. This city and my Mom were the only pleasant things I had to think about... The problem was, the more I thought about my Mom, the worse I felt. But I would feel better if I thought about the palace - the way it shimmers in the sunlight - the way the air always smells of flowers...
PADME	...and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls. The first time I saw the Capital, I was very young... I'd never seen a waterfall before. I though they were so beautiful... I never dreamed one day I'd live in the palace.
ANAKIN	Well, tell me, did you dream of power and politics when you were a little girl?
PADME	"No! That was the last thing I thought of. My dream was to help in the ""Refugee Relief Movement."" I never thought of running for elected office. But the more history I studied, the more I realised how much good politicians could do. So when I was eight, I joined the ""Apprentice Legislators"", then later on became a Senatorial advisor, with such a passion that, before I knew it, I was elected Queen. Partly because I scored so high on my education certificate, but for the most part it was my conviction that reform was possible. I wasn't the youngest Queen ever elected, but now that I think back on it, I'm not sure I was old enough. I'm not sure I was ready."
ANAKIN	The people you served thought you did a good job. I heard they tried to amend the Constitution so you could stay in office.
PADME	Popular rule is not democracy, Annie. It gives the people what they want, not what they need. And, truthfully, I was relieved when my two terms were up. So were my parents. They worried About me during the blockade and couldn't wait for it all to be over. Actually, I was hoping to have a family by now... My sisters have the most amazing, wonderful kids... but when the Queen asked me to serve as Senator, I couldn't refuse her.
ANAKIN	I agree! I think the Republic needs you... I'm glad you chose to serve. I feel things are going to happen in our generation that will change the galaxy in profound ways.
PADME	I think so too.
===	===
QUEEN JAMILLIA	We've been worried about you. I'm so glad you're safe, Padme.
PADME	Thank you, Your Highness. I only Wish I could have served you better by staying on Coruscant for the vote.
QUEEN JAMILLIA	How many systems have joined Count Dooku and the separatists?
PADME	About two hundred. And more are leaving the Republic every day. If the Senate votes to create an army, I'm sure it's going to push us into a civil war.
QUEEN JAMILLIA	Do you see any way, through negotiations, to bring the separatists back into the Republic?
PADME	Not if they feel threatened. The separatists don't have an army, but if they are provoked, they will move to defend themselves. I'm sure of that. And with no time or money to build an army, my guess is they will turn to the Commerce Guilds or the Trade Federation for help.
QUEEN JAMILLIA	The armies of commerce! Why has Nothing been done in the Senate to restrain them?
PADME	I'm afraid that, despite the Chancellor's best efforts, there are still many bureaucrats, judges, and even Senators on the payrolls of the Guilds.
QUEEN JAMILLIA	Remember, Counsellor, the courts were able to reduce the Federation's armies. That's a move in the right direction.
PADME	There are rumours, Your Highness, that the Federation Army was not reduced as they were ordered.
QUEEN JAMILLIA	We must keep our faith in the Republic. The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it.
PADME	Let's pray that day never comes.
SIO BIBBLE	What is your suggestion, Master Jedi?
PADME	Anakin's not a Jedi yet, Counsellor. He's still a Padawan learner. I was thinking...
ANAKIN	Hey, hold on a minute!
PADME	Excuse me! I was thinking I would stay in the Lake Country. There are some places up there that are very isolated.
ANAKIN	Excuse me?! I am in charge of security here, M'Lady.
PADME	Annie, my life is at risk, and this is my home. I know it very well... that is why we're here. I think it would be wise for you to take advantage of my knowledge in this instance.
===	===
RYOO & POOJA	Aunt Padme!! Aunt Padme!!
PADME	Ryoo!! Pooja!! I'm so happy to see you! This is Anakin. Anakin, this is Ryoo, and this is Pooja.
===	===
SOLA	They're eating over at Jev Narran's later, Mom. They just had a snack. They'll be fine.
PADME	Anakin, this is my sister, Sola.
ANAKIN	A little.
PADME	He's being polite, Mom. We're starving.
SOLA	Well, this is exciting! Do you know, Anakin, you're the first boyfriend my sister's ever brought home?
PADME	Sola!! He isn't my boyfriend! He's a Jedi assigned by the Senate to protect me.
JOVAL	A bodyguard?! Oh, Padme! They didn't tell us it was that serious!
PADME	It's not, Mom, I promise. Anyway, Anakin's a friend. I've known him for years. Remember that little boy who was with the Jedi during the blockade crisis? He grew up.
JOBAL	Honey, when are you going to settle down? Haven't you had enough of that life? I certainly have!
PADME	Mom, I'm not in any danger.
ANAKIN	...Yes... I'm afraid she is.
PADME	But not much.
===	===
SOLA	Why haven't you told us about him?
PADME	What's there to talk about?  He's just a boy.
SOLA	A boy? Have you seen the way he looks at you?
PADME	Sola - stop it!
SOLA	It's obvious he has feelings for you. Are you saying, little baby sister, that you haven't noticed?
PADME	I'm not your baby sister, Sola. Anakin and I are friends... our relationship is strictly professional. Mom, would you tell her to stop it?
SOLA	Well, maybe you haven't noticed the way he looks at you. I think you're afraid to.
PADME	Cut it out.
JOBAL	Sola's just concerned... we all are.
PADME	Oh, Mom, you're impossible. What I'm doing is important.
===	===
ANAKIN	I just want to get there before dark. You still live at home.
PADME	I move around so much, I've never had a place of my own. Official residences have no warmth. I feel good here. I feel at home.
ANAKIN	I never had a real home. Home was always where my Mom was. Is this you?
PADME	That was when I went with the Relief Group to Shadda-Bi-Boran. Their sun was imploding, and the planet was dying. I was helping to relocate the children. See that little one I'm holding? His name was N'a-kee-tula, which means sweethear. He was so full of life,. All those kids were. I did everything I could to save him, but he died... they all did. They were never able to adapt... to live off their native planet. My first day as an Apprentice Legislator. Notice the difference?
===	===
ANAKIN	I do too. I guess it comes from growing up on a desert planet.
PADME	...We used to lie on the sand and let the sun dry us... and try to guess the names of the birds singing.
ANAKIN	I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here everything's soft... and smooth...
PADME	There was a very old man who lived on the island. He used to make glass out of sand - and vases and necklaces out of the glass. They were magical.
ANAKIN	Everything here is magical.
PADME	You could look into the glass and see the water. The way it ripples and moves. It looked so real... but it wasn't.
ANAKIN	Sometimes, when you believe something to be real, it becomes real. Real enough, anyway...
PADME	I used to think if you looked too deeply into glass, you would lose yourself.
ANAKIN	I think it's true...
PADME	I shouldn't have done that.
ANAKIN	I'm sorry. When I'm around you, my mind is no longer my own.
PADME	It's the situation... the stress...
===	===
ANAKIN	What?
PADME	That! Now stop it! Anakin!!
===	===
ANAKIN	May I tell you something?
PADME	I don't know.
ANAKIN	Then how can I tell you?
PADME	Maybe you should use your Jedi intuition.
ANAKIN	It doesn't work around you. My mind is always a muddle... I can only think of you.
PADME	Anakin, don't...
ANAKIN	From the moment I met you, all those years ago, a day hasn't gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm close to you again, I'm in agony. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you mskes my stomach turn over - my mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I can't breathe. I'm haunted by the kiss you should never have given me. My heart is beating, hoping that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul, tormenting me. What can I do? I will do anything you ask... If you are suffering as much as I am, tell me.
PADME	...I can't. We can't. It's just not possible.
ANAKIN	Anything's possible. Padme, please listen...
PADME	You listen. We live in a real world. Come back to it. You're studying to become a Jedi Knight. I'm a Senator. If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion, they will take us to a place we cannot go... regardless of the way we feel about each other.
ANAKIN	Then you do feel something! There's an extraordinary connection between us. You can't deny that.
PADME	Annie, it doesn't make any difference. Jedi aren't allowed to marry. You swore an oath, remember? You'd be expelled from the Order. I will not let you give up your responsibilities... your future, for me.
ANAKIN	I was destined to be a Jedi. I don't think I could be anything else. But you are asking me to be rational. That is something I know I cannot do. I wish I could wish my feelings away... but I can't.
PADME	I am not going to give into this. I'm not going to throw my life away. I have more important things to do than fall in love.
ANAKIN	It wouldn't have to be that way... we could keep it a secret.
PADME	Then we'd be living a lie - one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to. Mt sister saw it. So did my mother. I couldn't do that. Could you, Anakin? Could you live like that?
===	===
ANAKIN	Sure you do... you just don't want to tell me.
PADME	Are you going to use one of your Jedi mind tricks on me?
ANAKIN	They only work on the weak-minded. You are anything but weak-minded.
PADME	All right... his name was Palo. I was twelve. We were both in the Legislative Youth Program. He was a few years older then I... very cute... dark curly hair... dreamy eyes.
ANAKIN	All right, I get the picture... whatever happened to him?
PADME	I went on to become a Queen. He went on to become an artist.
ANAKIN	Maybe he was the smart one.
PADME	You really don't like politicians, do you?
ANAKIN	I like two or three, but I'm not really sure about one of them. I don't think the system works.
PADME	How would you have it work?
ANAKIN	We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problems, agree what's in the best interests of all the people, and then do it.
PADME	That is exactly what we do. The trouble is that people don't wlways agree. In fact, they hardly ever do.
ANAKIN	Then they should be made to.
PADME	By whom? Who's going to make them?
ANAKIN	I don't know. Someone.
PADME	You?
ANAKIN	Of course not me.
PADME	But someone.
ANAKIN	Someone wise.
PADME	That sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.
ANAKIN	Well, if it works...
PADME	You're making fun of me.
ANAKIN	On no, I'd be much too frightened to tease a Senator.
PADME	You're so bad!
===	===
ANAKIN	Your presence is soothing.
PADME	You had a nightmare again last night.
ANAKIN	Jedi don't have nightmares.
PADME	I heard you.
ANAKIN	I saw my mother. I saw her as clearly as I see you now. She's suffering, Padme. She is in pain...They're killing her! I know I'm disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator. I know I will be punished and possibly thrown out of the Jedi Order, but I must go. I have to help her! I'm sorry, Padme. I don't have a choice.
PADME	Annie, I told you I wouldn't let you give up your future for me. I'll go with you. That way you can continue to protect me, and you won't be disobeying your mandate.
ANAKIN	What about Master Obi-wan?
PADME	I guess we won't tell him, will we?
===	===
C-3PO	Oh, my... oh, my! Master Anakin! My goodness, I can hardly believe it! And this must be Miss Padme.
PADME	Hello, Threepio.
C-3PO	Oh, dear! I'm so terribly sorry, Master Annie.
PADME	Threepio, what's happened?
===	===
BERU	Hello.
PADME	I'm Padme.
===	===
ANAKIN	To find my mother.
PADME	No, Annie!
===	===
OWEN	Take my speeder bike.
PADME	Anakin...
===	===
C-3PO	Please don't leave us, Miss Padme. These people need your help.
PADME	I'm not leaving, Threepio. I just can't sleep.
C-3PO	That's something I cannot relate to. As a Protocol Droid, I'm either active or inactive. There's no in-between.
PADME	I guess you're lucky.
C-3PO	Do you really think so..? I suppose I shouldn't expect...
PADME	You're not happy here?
C-3PO	Oh, I'm not unhappy... and my masters here ar so kind I wouldn't wish to trouuble them, it's just... being like this... well, it's embarrassing.
PADME	Being like what?
C-3PO	Naked. If you pardon the expression. You see, when Master Annie made me, he never quite found the time to give me any outer covering. It's so humiliating. How would you like it if you had to go around with all your circuits showing?
PADME	I guess I wouldn't like it at all.
C-3PO	Of course you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's simply not protocol.
PADME	Maybe we can do something about it.
C-3PO	I don't think so. Only Master Annie...
PADME	Why not? They seem to have a box of old coverings here.
C-3PO	Oh? How observant of you, Miss Padme. Of course, I'm just not mechanically minded... if you see what I mean.
PADME	Let's see, if we put this... here...
C-3PO	Ooooh! That's tickles.
PADME	You'll have to be quiet, Threepio. Hold still, please.
===	===
ANAKIN	I'm going after him!
PADME	I thought the first thing he said was to retransmit his message to Coruscant.
===	===
ANAKIN	Understood, Master.
PADME	They'll never get there in time to save him. They have to come half way across the galaxy. Look, Geonosis is less than a parsec away.
ANAKIN	If he's still alive.
PADME	Annie, are you just going to sit here and let him die?? He's your friend... your mentor...
ANAKIN	...He's like my father, but you heard Master Windu. He gave me strict orders to stay here.
PADME	He gave you strict orders to protect me... ...and I'm going to save Obi-Wan. So if you plan to protect me, you will have to come along.
===	===
ANAKIN	Hey, where are you going?
PADME	To find Obi-Wan.
ANAKIN	No! You're not!
PADME	Let go of me!
ANAKIN	I'm not letting you go out there. It's too dangerous.
PADME	What?!?
ANAKIN	It's my job to protect you. I said it's too dangerous. You're not going, and that's final!
PADME	Don't you give me orders, Annie! I'm a Senator of the Galactic Republic. You have no authority to contain me, restrain me, or direct me! You remember your place, young man. Now you can come along and protect me or stay here. It's up to you.
===	===
COUNT DOOKU	Senator Amidala, I've heard so much about you.
PADME	Count Dooku, I assume.
COUNT DOOKU	I'm delighted to meet you at last. We have a great deal to discuss, Senator. I hope you can keep your young Jedi under control.
PADME	Don't worry he's housebroken.
===	===
DOOKU	He has been convicted of espionage, Senator, and will be executed. In just a few hours, I believe.
PADME	He is an officer of the Republic. You can't do that.
DOOKU	We don't recognise the Republic here, Senator. But if Naboo were to join our Alliance, I could easily hear your plea for clemency.
PADME	And if I don't join your rebellion, I assume this Jedi with me will also die?
DOOKU	I don't wish to make you to join our cause against your will, Senator, but you are a rational, honest representative of your people and I assume you want to do what's in their best interest. Aren't you fed up with the corruption, the bureaucrats, the hypocrisy of it all?.. Aren't you? Be honest, Senator.
PADME	The ideals are still alive, Count, even if the institution is failing.
DOOKU	You believe in the same ideals we believe in! The same ideals we are striving to make prominent.
PADME	If what you say is true, you should stay in the Republic and help Chancellor Palpatine put things right.
DOOKU	The Chancellor means well, M'Lady but he is incompetent. He has promised to cut the bureaucracy, but the bureaucrats are stronger than ever, no? Senator, the Republic cannot be fixed. It is time to start over. The democratic process in the Republic is a sham, a shell game played on the voters. It will not be long before the cult of greed, called the Republic, will lose even the pretext of democracy and freedom.
PADME	I cannot believe that. I will not forsake all I have honoured and worked for and betray the Republic. I know of your treaties with the Trade Federation, the Commerce Guilds, and the others, Count. What is happening here is not government that has been bought out by business... it's business becoming government!
DOOKU	Are you willing to betray your Jedi friends? Without your co-operation I can do nothing to stop their execution.
PADME	What is to happen to me? Am I to be executed also?
DOOKU	You may cause a lot of bloodshed, my young Jedi, but you will not escape.
PADME	Anakin...
===	===
POGGLE	Do you have anything to say before your sentence is carried out?
PADME	You are committing an act of war, Archduke. I hope you are prepared for the consequences.
===	===
ANAKIN	Don't be afraid.
PADME	I'm not afraid to die. I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.
ANAKIN	What are you talking about?
PADME	I love you.
ANAKIN	You love me?! I thought we decided not to fall in love. That we would be forced to live a lie. That it would destroy our lives...
PADME	I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway. My love for you is a puzzle, Annie, for which I have no answers. I can't control it... and now I don't care. I truly, deeply love you, and before we die I want you to know.
===	===
ANAKIN	You okay?
PADME	Sure! Well, sort of.
===	===
COUNT DOOKU	Then, I'm sorry, old friend. You will have to be destroyed.
PADME	Look!
===	===
COUNT DOOKU	...Not yet...
PADME	Anakin!
===	===
