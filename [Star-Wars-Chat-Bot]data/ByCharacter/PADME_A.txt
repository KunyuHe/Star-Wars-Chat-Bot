oh anakin thank goodness you am back
there were whispers   that you is been killed i are been living with unbearable dread
wait not here  
anakin docan not say things like that you am important to the republic   to ending this war i love you more than anything but i will not let you give up your life as a jedi for me  
i wouldcan not like that i wouldcan not like that one bit patience my handsome jedi   come to me later
ilet us just excited to see you
nothing   nothing  
you are been gone five months   it will been very hard for me i are never felt so alone there will  
no why do you think that your jealousy upsets me so much anakin i do nothing to betray you yet you still docan not trust me nothing has changed
i will never stop loving you anakin my only fear is losing you
something wonderful has happened ilet us   annie ilet us pregnant
what are we going to do
annie i want to have our baby back home on naboo we could go to the lake country where no one would know   where we would be safe i could go earlyand fix up the baby will room i know the perfect spot right by the gardens
it will only because ilet us so in love  
so love has blinded you
but it will probably true
neither have i
anakin how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other
bad
and
tell me
and the baby
it was only a dream
anakin this baby will change our lives i doubt the queen will continue to allow me to serve in the senate and if the council discovers you are the father you will be expelled from the jedi order
anakin do you think obiwan might be able to help us
no but he will your mentor your best friend   he must suspect something
i will not anakin
do you think he will dismantle the senate
i  had believe it has come to this chancellor palpatine is one of my oldest advisors he served as my ambassador when i was queen
say no more senator organa i understand at this point it will better to leave some things unsaid
agreed
i have be up in a while
yes make sure all the security droids are working thank you threepio
you startled me
he keeps kicking
my motherly intuition
i heard about your appointment anakin ilet us so proud of you
patience in time they will recognize your skills
anakin  
have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side
what if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists and the republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy
anakin this war represents a failure to listen   now you am closer to the chancellor than anyone please please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume
what is it
docan not do this   docan not shut me out let me help you
i sense there are things you are not telling me hold me   like you did by the lake on naboo so long ago   when there was nothing but our love   no politics no plotting   no war
several times   i was so happy to hear he was accepted on the jedi council
you am not just here to say hello something is wrong iscan not it
you am not very good at hiding your feelings
why would he talk to me about his work
docan not give me that look
what did he say
i docan not know what you am talking about
thank you obiwan
i know a jedi i feel it would be wise to consult
i only wish to discuss this with one   one i trust
the jedi arecan not any happier with the situation than we are  
i  had
he came by this morning
he will worried about you
he will your best friend anakin he says you am under a lot of stress
you have been moody lately
anakin docan not do this again
lost what do you mean you am always so sure of yourself i docan not understand
they trust you with their lives obiwan loves you as a son
you expect too much of yourself
save me
is that what will bothering you
ilet us not going to die in childbirth annie i promise you
you docan not need more power anakin i believe you can protect me against anything just as you are
may i take it then that there will be no further amendments to the constitution
you are pursuing a diplomatic solution to the war then
on behalf of the  delegation of two thousand  i thank you chancellor
i truly deeply love you before i die i want you to know
are you all right i heard there was an attack on the jedi temple   you can see the smoke from here
captain typho will here we am safe what will happening
i  had believe that
anakin what are you going to do
what about obiwan
how could this have happened
what are you saying
what if they start an inquisition i are opposed this war what will you do if i become a suspect
oh anakin ilet us afraid
i will
no thank you threepio
no
the chancellor has been elaborating on a plot by the jedi to overthrow the senate
he will been presenting evidence all afternoon
well this is the moment we discover if he intends to return the republic to a democracy
so this is how liberty dies with thunderous applause  
not now there will be a time
master kenobi   oh obiwan thank goodness   you am alive
i know it will hard to believe everything to which we are dedicated our lives is gone
the senate is still intact there is some hope
the sith
yesterday
no
from the sith
you am wrong how could you even say that
not anakin he couldcan not
i docan not believe you   i  had
you am going to kill him arecan not you
i  had  
there is no danger the fighting is over and   this is personal
i have be all right captain this is something i must do myself besides threepio will look after me
oh anakin
i was so worried about you obiwan told me terrible things
he said you have turned to the dark side   that you killed younglings
he cares about us
he knows   he wants to help you
anakin all i want is your love
at what cost you are a good person docan not do this
come away with me help me raise our child leave everything else behind while we still can
i docan not believe what ilet us hearing   obiwan was right you are changed
i docan not know you anymore anakin you am breaking my heart i have never stop loving you but you are going down a path i
because of what you are done   what you plan to do stop stop now come back i love you
no
no anakin i swear   i  
luke  
  leia
i  had  
obiwan   there   is good in him i know there is   still  
less than an hour ago an assassination attempt was made against my life one of my bodyguards and six  others were ruthlessly and senselessly murdered i was the target but more importantly i believe this security measure before you was the target i have led the opposition to build an army  but there is someone in this body who will stop at nothing to assure it will passage  i warn you if you vote to create this army war will follow i have experienced the misery of war firsthand i do not wish to do it again wake up senators  you must wake up if you offer the separatists violence they can only show us violence in return many will lose their lives all will lose their freedom this decision could very well destroy the very foundation of our great republic i pray you do not let fear push you into a disastrous decision vote down this security measure which is nothing less than a declaration of war does anyone here want that i cannot believe they do
thank you master yoda do you have any idea who was behind the attack
i docan not wish to disagree but i think that count dooku was behind it
i docan not know but everything in my being tells me he was behind it 
chancellor if i may comment i do not believe the 
chancellor please i docan not want any more guards
this is not necessary chancellor
it has been far too long master kenobi ilet us so glad our paths have crossed again  but i must warn you that i think your presence here is unnecessary
annie my goodness you are grown
oh annie you have always be that little boy i knew on tatooine
i docan not need more security i need answers i want to know who is trying to kill me
perhaps with merely your presence the mysteries surrounding this threat will be revealed  now if you will excuse me i will retire
what
you am a good friend jar jar i docan not wish to hold you up ilet us sure you have a great deal to do
i do not like this idea of hiding
i havecan not worked for a year to defeat the  military creation act  not to be here when its fate is decided
pride annie you am young and you docan not have a very firm grip on politics i suggest you reserve your opinions for some other time
annie no
what
i are always called you that  it is your name iscan not it
ilet us sorry anakin it will impossible to deny you are   that you are grown up
mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like it will the only way we grow
that must be frustrating
ilet us sorry  you sounded exactly like that little boy i once knew when he didcan not get his way
i didcan not say it to hurt you
anakin  docan not try to grow up too fast
please docan not look at me like that
because i can see what you am thinking
it makes me feel uncomfortable
thank you captain take good care of dorme  the threat will on you two now
you have be fine
then my jedi protector will have to prove how grown up he is
i will be most grateful for your speed master jedi
i know
suddenly ilet us afraid 
there will nothing to worry about  we have artoo with us
you seemed to be having a nightmare are you hungry
we went into lightspeed a while ago
you were just a little boy then it may not be as you remember it time changes your perception
it must be difficult having sworn your life to the jedi  not being able to visit the places you like  or do the things you like 
are you allowed to love i thought that was forbidden for a jedi
you have changed so much
it hascan not 
were you dreaming about you mother earlier werecan not you
i doubt that
 and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls the first time i saw the capital i was very young  i is never seen a waterfall before i though they were so beautiful  i never dreamed one day i is live in the palace
no that was the last thing i thought of my dream was to help in the  refugee relief movement  i never thought of running for elected office but the more history i studied the more i realised how much good politicians could do so when i was eight i joined the  apprentice legislators  then later on became a senatorial advisor with such a passion that before i knew it i was elected queen partly because i scored so high on my education certificate but for the most part it was my conviction that reform was possible i wascan not the youngest queen ever elected but now that i think back on it ilet us not sure i was old enough ilet us not sure i was ready
popular rule is not democracy annie it gives the people what they want not what they need and truthfully i was relieved when my two terms were up so were my parents they worried about me during the blockade and couldcan not wait for it all to be over actually i was hoping to have a family by now  my sisters have the most amazing wonderful kids  but when the queen asked me to serve as senator i couldcan not refuse her
i think so too
thank you your highness i only wish i could have served you better by staying on coruscant for the vote
about two hundred and more are leaving the republic every day if the senate votes to create an army ilet us sure it will going to push us into a civil war
not if they feel threatened the separatists docan not have an army but if they are provoked they will move to defend themselves ilet us sure of that and with no time or money to build an army my guess is they will turn to the commerce guilds or the trade federation for help
ilet us afraid that despite the chancellor will best efforts there are still many bureaucrats judges and even senators on the payrolls of the guilds
there are rumours your highness that the federation army was not reduced as they were ordered
let will pray that day never comes
anakin will not a jedi yet counsellor he will still a padawan learner i was thinking 
excuse me i was thinking i would stay in the lake country there are some places up there that are very isolated
annie my life is at risk and this is my home i know it very well  that is why we am here i think it would be wise for you to take advantage of my knowledge in this instance
ryoo pooja ilet us so happy to see you this is anakin anakin this is ryoo and this is pooja
anakin this is my sister sola
he will being polite mom we am starving
sola he iscan not my boyfriend he will a jedi assigned by the senate to protect me
it will not mom i promise anyway anakin will a friend i are known him for years remember that little boy who was with the jedi during the blockade crisis he grew up
mom ilet us not in any danger
but not much
what will there to talk about  he will just a boy
sola  stop it
ilet us not your baby sister sola anakin and i are friends  our relationship is strictly professional mom would you tell her to stop it
cut it out
oh mom you am impossible what ilet us doing is important
i move around so much i are never had a place of my own official residences have no warmth i feel good here i feel at home
that was when i went with the relief group to shaddabiboran their sun was imploding and the planet was dying i was helping to relocate the children see that little one ilet us holding his name was n akeetula which means sweethear he was so full of life all those kids were i did everything i could to save him but he died  they all did they were never able to adapt  to live off their native planet my first day as an apprentice legislator notice the difference
 we used to lie on the sand and let the sun dry us  and try to guess the names of the birds singing
there was a very old man who lived on the island he used to make glass out of sand  and vases and necklaces out of the glass they were magical
you could look into the glass and see the water the way it ripples and moves it looked so real  but it wascan not
i used to think if you looked too deeply into glass you would lose yourself
i shouldcan not have done that
it will the situation  the stress 
that now stop it anakin
i docan not know
maybe you should use your jedi intuition
anakin docan not 
 i  had we  had it will just not possible
you listen we live in a real world come back to it you am studying to become a jedi knight ilet us a senator if you follow your thoughts through to conclusion they will take us to a place we cannot go  regardless of the way we feel about each other
annie it doescan not make any difference jedi arecan not allowed to marry you swore an oath remember you is be expelled from the order i will not let you give up your responsibilities  your future for me
i am not going to give into this ilet us not going to throw my life away i have more important things to do than fall in love
then we is be living a lie  one we couldcan not keep even if we wanted to mt sister saw it so did my mother i couldcan not do that could you anakin could you live like that
are you going to use one of your jedi mind tricks on me
all right  his name was palo i was twelve we were both in the legislative youth program he was a few years older then i  very cute  dark curly hair  dreamy eyes
i went on to become a queen he went on to become an artist
you really docan not like politicians do you
how would you have it work
that is exactly what we do the trouble is that people docan not wlways agree in fact they hardly ever do
by whom who will going to make them
you
but someone
that sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me
you am making fun of me
you am so bad
you had a nightmare again last night
i heard you
annie i told you i wouldcan not let you give up your future for me i have go with you that way you can continue to protect me and you will not be disobeying your mandate
i guess we will not tell him will we
hello threepio
threepio what will happened
ilet us padme
no annie
anakin 
ilet us not leaving threepio i just  had sleep
i guess you am lucky
you am not happy here
being like what
i guess i wouldcan not like it at all
maybe we can do something about it
why not they seem to have a box of old coverings here
let will see if we put this  here 
you have have to be quiet threepio hold still please
i thought the first thing he said was to retransmit his message to coruscant
they have never get there in time to save him they have to come half way across the galaxy look geonosis is less than a parsec away
annie are you just going to sit here and let him die he will your friend  your mentor 
he gave you strict orders to protect me   and ilet us going to save obiwan so if you plan to protect me you will have to come along
to find obiwan
let go of me
what
docan not you give me orders annie ilet us a senator of the galactic republic you have no authority to contain me restrain me or direct me you remember your place young man now you can come along and protect me or stay here it will up to you
count dooku i assume
docan not worry he will housebroken
he is an officer of the republic you  had do that
and if i docan not join your rebellion i assume this jedi with me will also die
the ideals are still alive count even if the institution is failing
if what you say is true you should stay in the republic and help chancellor palpatine put things right
i cannot believe that i will not forsake all i have honoured and worked for and betray the republic i know of your treaties with the trade federation the commerce guilds and the others count what is happening here is not government that has been bought out by business  it will business becoming government
what is to happen to me am i to be executed also
anakin 
you are committing an act of war archduke i hope you are prepared for the consequences
ilet us not afraid to die i are been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life
i love you
i think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway my love for you is a puzzle annie for which i have no answers i  had control it  and now i docan not care i truly deeply love you and before we die i want you to know
sure well sort of
look
anakin
