They are of pain, suffering, death . . .
Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?
Someone . . .
. . . close to you?
Yes.
Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.
I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda.
Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.
What must I do, Master Yoda?
Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.
I will do my best to uphold the principles of the Jedi Order.
Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.
We have surveyed all systems in the Republic, and have found no sign of General Grievous.
Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep.
And yet, it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup.
Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait.
Skywalker, your assignment is here with the Chancellor, and Kenobi must find General Grievous.
Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.
Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.
Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.
So the prophecy says.
A prophecy . . . that misread could have been.
He will not let me down. He never has.
I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you.
A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.
Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.
Yes, this decision is ours to make.
A Master is needed, with more experience.
Oh no, you're quite right, but I do have the most experience with his ways of combat.
Obi-Wan, my choice is.
I concur. Master Kenobi should go.
I agree.
The droids have started up their main power generators.
Then now the time is, Commander.
. . . and replace the Congress with Senators who are not filled with greed and corruption.
To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmmmmm. . . . great care we must take.
Everyone out of there!
Wookiee good . . . eat Wookiee.
Did you find something?
It's nothing, nothing.
Yes, sir.
Right you are, Chewbacca. Faster that will be. Stink, this mud does. A moment to bathe, give me. Not far, are we, from the emergency ship. Quickly . . .
You made it.
Master Kenobi, dark times are these. Good to see you. it is.
You were attacked by your Clones, also?
With the help of the Wookiees, barely escape, I did.
How many other Jedi managed to survive?
Heard from no one, have we.
Have we had any contact from the Temple?
Received a coded retreat message, we have.
It's too dangerous to return.
Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?
Yes, Master. There is too much at stake here, and we need a clearer picture of what has happened.
I agree. In a dark place we find ourselves ... a little more knowledge might light our way.
No, I don't think so. The Chancellor will not be able to control the thousands of star systems without keeping the Senate intact.
If a special session of Congress there is, easier for us to enter the Jedi Temple it will be.
There are several battalions of Clone Troopers on every level. Many are dressed as Jedi.
Dismantle the coded signal quickly. That group back there, soon discovered will be.
Not even the younglings survived.
Killed not by clones, this Padawan. By a lightsaber, he was.
I've recalibrated the code warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.
Good . . . For the Clones to discover the recalibration, a long time it will take. To change it back, longer still. Hurry.
Wait, Master. There is something I must know . . .
If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.
I can't watch any more.
Destroy the Sith, we must.
Send me to kill the Emperor. I will not kill Anakin.
To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not.
He is like my brother ... I cannot do it.
Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has become. The boy you trained, gone he is . . . Consumed by Darth Vader.
How could it have come to this?
To question, no time there is.
I do not know where the Emperor has sent him. I don't know where to look.
Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him, you will. Visit the new Emperor, my task is. May the Force be with you.
Master Yoda, you survived.
Surprised?
I have waited a long time for this moment, my little green friend. At last, the Jedi are no more.
Not if anything I have to say about it, Lord Sidious. At an end your rule is and not short enough it was, I must say. If so powerful you are, why leave??
You will not stop me. Darth Vader will become more powerful than either of us.
Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be, as is your faith in the dark side of the Force.
Patience. You will have time. I did not. When I became one with the Force I made a great discovery. With my training, you will be able to merge with the Force at will. Your physical self will fade away, but you will still retain your consciousness. You will become more powerful than any Sith.
Eternal consciousness.
The ability to defy oblivion can be achieved, but only for oneself. It was accomplished by a Shaman of the Whills. It is a state acquired through compassion, not greed.
. . . to become one with the Force, and influence still have . . . A power greater than all, it is.
You will learn to let go of everything. No attachment, no thought of self. No physical self.
A great Jedi Master, you have become, Qui-Gon Jinn. Your apprentice I gratefully become.
She's carrying twins.
Save them, we must. They are our last hope.
We must take them somewhere the Sith will not sense their presence.
Split up, they should be.
And what of the boy?
To Tatooine. To his family, send him.
I will take the child and watch over him. Master Yoda, do you think Anakin's twins will be able to defeat Darth Sidious?
Strong the Force runs, in the Skywalker line. Hope, we can . . . Done, it is. Until the time is right, disappear we will. Master Kenobi, wait a moment. In your solitude on Tatooine, training I have for you.
Training??
An old friend has learned the path to immortality.
Who?
One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force to train me . . . your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.
Qui-Gon? But, how could he accomplish this?
The secret of the Ancient Order of the Whills, he studied. How to commune with him. I will teach you.
I will be able to talk with him?
How to join the Force, he will train you. Your consciousness you will retain, when one with the Force. Even your physical self, perhaps.
Master Yoda, do you think it will really come to war?
Worse than war, I fear... Much worse.
What do you sense, Master?
Impossible to see ... The Dark Side clouds everything. But this I am sure of - Do their duty the Jedi will.
Send them in.
With you the force is strong... young Senator. To see you alive brings warm feeling to my heart.
He is a political idealist, not a murderer.
In dark times nothing is what it appears to be, but the fact remains Senator, in grave danger you are.
I will have Obi-Wan report to you immediately, M'Lady.
Too little about yourself you worry, Senator, and too much about politics. Be mindful of your danger, Padme. Accept our help.
Why couldn't we see this attack on the Senator?
Masking the future, is this disturbance in the Force.
The propecy is coming true, the Dark Side is growing.
And only those who have turned to the Dark Side can sense the possibilities of the future. Only going through the Dark Side can we see.
It's been ten years, and the Sith still have no shown themselves. Do you think they are behind this?
...Out there, they are. A certainty that is.
Do you think Obi-Wan's apprentice will be able to bring balance to the Force?
Only if he chooses to follow his destiny.
I am sorry to disturb you, Master.
What help to you, can I be?
I'm looking for a planet described to me by an old friend. I trust him. But the system doesn't show up on the archive maps.
An interesting puzzle. Gather round the map reader, younglings. Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet. Find it, we will try...
This is where it ought to be... but it isn't. Gravity is pulling all the stars in this area inward to this spot. There should be a star here... but there isn't.
Most interesting. Gravity's silhouette remains, but the star and all its planets have disappeared. How can this be?
If the planet blew up, the gravity would go away.
Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is. Uncluttered. To the centre of the pull of gravity go, and find your planet you will.
But Master Yoda who could have erased information from the archives? That's impossible, isn't it?
Much harder to answer, that question is.
I am concerned for my Padawan. He is not ready to be on his own.
The Council is confident in this decision, Obi-Wan.
I have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter is the assassin we're looking for.
Who he is working for... discover that, you must.
A clone army! Ordered by someone in the Senate perhaps... Someone's out to start a war.
Inform the chancellor of this, we must.
One more thing. Jango mentioned he was recruited by someone named Darth Tyranus. Any idea who that might be?
With the forename Darth, a Sith he must be.
Do you believe he could be the mysterious Sido-Dyas, who made the deal for the clone army?
Perhaps too many pieces are missing from this puzzle, there are.
Please, please, I don't wish to have emergency powers. That's too extreme a solution. It's akin to a dictatorship. We must rely on the Jedi. Master Yoda, how many are available to go to Geonosis?
Two Hundred,... less or more.
The longer we wait, the stronger Dooku's armies become. We cannot wait for the Senate to make up its mind about granting the Chancellor emergency powers, in order to be able to use that clone army... We have the authority to go now. We must go now.
Agreed, Master Windu. Two hundred Jedi send. Enough, let's hope they are.
Look!
Come on - hurry! Hurry!
Master Yoda. At last we shall know who is the most powerful.
Count Dooku. No interest in contests, do I have. The end for you, Count, this is.
On his way back to Naboo. He is escorting Senator Amidala home. I must admit without the clones, it would not have been a victory.
Victory? Victory, you say? Not victory, a defeat, it was... Master Obi-Wan. Begun, the Clone War has!
No... of course not.
I do, yes, I do!  Sick have I become. Old and weak. (Points a crooked finger) When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm? Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have.
Master Yoda, you can't die.
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things ... the way of the Force.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
Then I am a Jedi?
Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.
Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?
Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.
Yoda, I must know.
Your father he is. Told you, did he?
Yes.
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you.
Well, I'm sorry.
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I (cough), the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... (with great effort) There is... another...Sky...Sky...walker.
Like we're being watched!
Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm. I am wondering, why are you here?
I'm looking for someone.
Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm?
Right.
Help you I can. Yes, mmmm.
I don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior.
Ahhh! A great warrior.  Wars not make one great.
Put that down. Hey! That's my dinner.
How you get so big, eating food of this kind?
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just...
Aww, cannot get your ship out?
Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh...you're making a mess. Hey, give me that!
Mine! Or I will help you not.
I don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole.
Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is. Ah, ah, ah!
Oh, Artoo, let him have it.
Mine! Mine!
Artoo!
Mine!
Now will you move along, little fella? We're got a lot of work to do.
No! No, no! Stay and help you, I will.  Find your friend, hmm?
I'm not looking for a friend, I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda.
You know him?
Mmm. Take you to him, I will.  Yes, yes. But now, we must eat. Come. Good food. Come. Come, come.
Look, I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we can't see Yoda now.
Patience! For the Jedi it is time to eat as well. Eat, eat. Hot. Good food, hm? Good, hmm?
How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there?
Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him. (tasting food from the pot) Rootleaf, I cook. Why wish you become Jedi? Hm?
Mostly because of my father, I guess.
Ah, your father. Powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi, mmm.
Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am. (fed up) Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time.
I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience.
He will learn patience.
Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father.
Was I any different when you taught me?
Hah. He is not ready.
Yoda! I am ready. I...Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm ready.
Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. (to the invisible Ben, indicating Luke) This one a long time have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. (turning to Luke) You are reckless!
So was I, if you'll remember.
He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training.
But I've learned so much.
Will he finished what he begins?
I won't fail you -- I'm not afraid.
Oh, you will be. You will be.
Vader. Is the dark side stronger?
No...no...no. Quicker, easier, more seductive.
But how am I to know the good side from the bad?
You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.
But tell me why I can't...
No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmm.
There's something not right here. I feel cold, death.
That place...is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go.
What's in there?
Only what you take with you. Your weapons...you will not need them.
Oh, no. We'll never get it out now.
So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say?
Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally different.
No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned.
All right, I'll give it a try.
No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.
I can't. It's too big.
Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm? Mmmm. And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It's energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we...(Yoda pinches Luke's shoulder)...not this crude matter. (a sweeping gesture) You must feel the Force around you. (gesturing) Here, between you...me...the tree...the rock...everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship!
You want the impossible. I don't...I don't believe it.
That is why you fail.
Han! Leia!
Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control.
I saw...I saw a city in the clouds.
Mmm. Friends you have there.
They were in pain.
It is the future you see.
Future? Will they die?
Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.
I've got to go to them.
Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.
I can't keep the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I've got to help them.
You must not go!
But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force.
Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure at the cave!
You won't.
Stopped they must be. On this depends. Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil.
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
If you honor what they fight for...yes!
Luke, don't give in to hate -- that leads to the dark side.
Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.
I will. And I'll return. I promise.
Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse.
That boy is our last hope.
No. There is another.
