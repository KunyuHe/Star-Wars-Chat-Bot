Thank you, Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the Separatists, but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to take advantage of.
It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that. Well, there, I agree with you. In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.
Yes, my lady.
Is there anything I might do for you, my lady?
I truly, deeply love you. Before I die. I want you to know.
My Lady, are you. . . . Are you all right?
Captain Typho's here, we're safe. What's happening?
What is going on? You can't be anymore confused than I am.
I couldn't either at first, but it's true. I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the Chancellor myself.
Something important is going on! I heard a rumor they are going to banish all droids. Shhhhhh . . . not so loud. Whatever it is, we'll be the last to know.
I will.
Well, he is under a lot of stress, Artoo. Take care, my little friend. My Lady, is there anything I might do?
No.
I feel so helpless.
Has Anakin been here . . . ?
Yes . . . right after the attack on the Jedi Temple.
I'll be all right, Captain. This is something I must do myself. Besides, Threepio will look after me.
Oh, dear.
Save them, we must. They are our last hope.
It s some kind of reproductive process, I think.
I'm placing these droids in your care. Treat them well. Clean them up. Have the Protocol Droid's mind wiped.
Oh, no.
Threepio?
Oh, my... oh, my! Master Anakin! My goodness, I can hardly believe it! And this must be Miss Padme.
I've come to see my mother.
Oh, dear! I'm so terribly sorry, Master Annie.
Threepio, what's happened?
I think we'd better go inside.
I'm not leaving, Threepio. I just can't sleep.
That's something I cannot relate to. As a Protocol Droid, I'm either active or inactive. There's no in-between.
I guess you're lucky.
Do you really think so..? I suppose I shouldn't expect...
You're not happy here?
Oh, I'm not unhappy... and my masters here ar so kind I wouldn't wish to trouuble them, it's just... being like this... well, it's embarrassing.
Being like what?
Naked. If you pardon the expression. You see, when Master Annie made me, he never quite found the time to give me any outer covering. It's so humiliating. How would you like it if you had to go around with all your circuits showing?
I guess I wouldn't like it at all.
Of course you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's simply not protocol.
Maybe we can do something about it.
I don't think so. Only Master Annie...
Why not? They seem to have a box of old coverings here.
Oh? How observant of you, Miss Padme. Of course, I'm just not mechanically minded... if you see what I mean.
Let's see, if we put this... here...
Ooooh! That's tickles.
There!
Um. How do I look?
Great! You look perfect.
Perfect? Oh, Miss Padme, I'm so happy! Oh, pardon me. Thank you. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
Well, Padme, I think he should be yours from now on... I know that is what my Mom would want.
Oh, my!
Don't you give me orders, Annie! I'm a Senator of the Galactic Republic. You have no authority to contain me, restrain me, or direct me! You remember your place, young man. Now you can come along and protect me or stay here. It's up to you.
Yes, it is, Artoo. Most confusing. One moment they're generating a pleasant mutual attraction and the next, waves of violent hostility. Even though I'm programmed to understand them, I doubt if I ever shall.
I have no need for a protocol droid.
Sir - not in an environment such as this - that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...
What I really need is a droid that understands the binary languages of moisture vaporators.
Vaporators!  Sir - My first job was programming binary load lifters ... very similar to your vaporators. You could say...
Do you speak Bocce?
Of course I can, sir.  It's like a second language for me...  I'm as fluent in Bocce...
All right; shut up! I'll take this one.
Shutting up, sir.
Hey, what're you trying to push on us?
Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition.  A real bargain.
Yeah, take it away.
Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir.  He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before.  Here he comes.
Okay, let's go.
Now, don't forget this!  Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity!
It just isn't fair.  Oh, Biggs is right.  I'm never gonna get out of here!
Is there anything I might do to help?
Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!
I don't think so, sir.  I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.  Not on this planet, anyways.  As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.
Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.
I see, sir.
Uh, you can call me Luke.
I see, sir Luke.
Just Luke.
And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.
Hello. You got a lot of carbon scoring here.  It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.
With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.
You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.
Have you been in many battles?
Several, I think.  Actually, there's not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.
What's this?
What is what?!?  He asked you a question... What is that?
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.
Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction.  Old data. Pay it no mind.
Who is she?  She's beautiful.
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...
I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.  A person of some importance, sir - I believe.  Our captain was attached to...
Is there more to this recording?
Behave yourself, Artoo.  You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him.  He's our new master. He says he's the property of Obi- Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts.  And it's a private message for him.  Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what he's talking about.  Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.
Obi-Wan Kenobi?  I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?
I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?
Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea.  He's kind of a strange old hermit. I wonder who she is.  It sounds like she's in trouble.  I'd better play back the whole thing.
He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system.  He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.
H'm?  Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off!  Okay. There you go. Well, wait a minute.  Where'd she go?  Bring her back!  Play back the entire message.
What message?  The one you√ïve just been playing.  The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards!
All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.
I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.
Well, see what you can do with him.  I'll be right back.
Just you reconsider playing that message for him. No, I don't think he likes you at all. No, I don't like you either.
What are you doing hiding there?
It wasn't my fault, sir.  Please don't deactivate me.  I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.
How could I be so stupid?  He's nowhere in sight.  Blast it!
Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?
All right, I'll be there in a few minutes.  Boy, am I gonna get it. You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.
Oh, he excels at that, sir.
How's that. Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far.  We must have missed him.  Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well.
Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault.
Sure.  He needs you.  He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...
Deactivate!  Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt...
Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?
Master Luke here is your rightful owner.  We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me of your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.
Well, come on. It's getting late. I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up.
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop.
No, he's not going to try anything. What's wrong with him now?
Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before the Sand People return.
I don't think I can make it.  You go on, Master Luke.  There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.  And he was a good friend.  Which reminds me... I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.
Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile.
I'm ready for anything.
Come along, Artoo.
Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder.  We don't want any trouble.
I heartily agree with you sir.
All right, check that side of the street.  It's secure.  Move on to the next door.
I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you.  I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault. You watch your language!
Chewie, get us out of here!
Oh, my.  I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.
Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.  I told you I'd outrun 'em. Don't everyone thank me at once. Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.
Now be careful, Artoo. He made a fair move.  Screaming about it won't help you.
Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.
That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose.  Wookiees are known to do that.
I see your point, sir.  I suggest a new strategy, Artoo.  Let the Wookiee win.
Bring them on!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
We found the computer outlet, sir.
Plug in.  He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.
He says he's found the main control to the power beam that's holding the ship here.  He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor. The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.
Who do you think... What is it?
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says "I found her," and keeps repeating, "She's here."
Well, who... who has he found?
Princess Leia.
Princess?  What's going on?
Level five. Detention block AA- twenty-three.  I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.
Don't worry, Chewie.  I think I know what he has in mind.
Master Luke, sir!  Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?
And hope they don't have blasters.
That isn't very reassuring.
See-Threepio!  See-Threepio!
Yes sir?
Open up in there!
Oh, no!
Take over! See to him!  Look there!
They're madmen!  They're heading for the prison level.  If you hurry, you might catch them.
Follow me!  You stand guard.
Come on! Oh!  All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here.  If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance.
Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.
No.  Shut them all down!  Hurry! Listen to them!  They're dying, Artoo!  Curse my metal body!  I wasn't fast enough.  It's all my fault!  My poor master!
See-Threepio, do you copy?
For the moment.  Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship.
Okay, easy she goes!
Hang on tight, Artoo, you've got to come back. You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?
Oh, no!
Oh, my!  Artoo!  Can you hear me? Say something! You can repair him, can't you?
We'll get to work on him right away.
You must repair him!  Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them.
Tee chuta hhat yudd!
Goodness gracious me! Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt. I don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go. Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this. Oh, Artoo!  Artoo, wait for me!
Die Wanna Wanga!
Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt. ... and a gift. (thinks a moment, then to Artoo) Gift, what gift?
Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.
He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself. I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things.
Nudd Chaa.
Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this.
Bo Shuda!
The message, Artoo, the message.
Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. (Jabba's crowd laughs) With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids.
What did he say?
... Both are hardworking and will serve you well.
This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message.
There will be no bargain.
We're doomed.
I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he is.
Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite.
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
Yes or no will do.
Oh. Well, yes.
How many languages do you speak?
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
Disintegrated?
Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining bolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber.
Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh!
I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.
Oh, no! Chewbacca!
At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.
Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes! Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty- five thousand.
I want fifty thousand. No less.
Uh, oh... but what, what did I say? (to Boushh) Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand. Because he's holding a thermal detonator.
This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive.
Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.
Zeebuss.
He agrees!
Ugh!
Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers.
Master Luke, you're standing on...
I'm here.
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
Good, I hate long waits.
You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.
Doesn't sound so bad.
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
Soon you will learn to appreciate me.
Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here? Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too! Hmm.  I wish I had your confidence.
Come on. We gotta get out of here quick.
Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!
Get the gun! Point it at the deck! Point it at the deck!
Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump.
We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator.
Sounds dangerous.
Hi, Han... Chewie.
Exciting is hardly the word I would use.
All set.
Here we go again.
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
Don't worry, Master Luke.  We know what to do. And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!
Luke! Luke!
Oh, Master Luke.
There's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.
I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.
Yeah, sure.
Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-op!!
Han, don't. It'll be all right. Chewie, give 'em your crossbow.
Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness!
Do you understand anything they're saying?
Oh, yes, Master Luke!  Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication.
What are you telling them?
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
Proper?!
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
I have a really bad feeling about this. What did he say?
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
Oh!
Your Royal Highness.
Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
But Master Luke, what magic? couldn't possibly --
Just tell them.
You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just... ... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh! Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh! Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness.
Thanks, Threepio.
I...I never knew I had it in me.
I don't know.
Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.
Just what I always wanted. Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie. (to Wicket) Thank you. Okay.
He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator.
What's he saying?
He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
Then we'll do it real quiet-like.
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
Quiet.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this.
I have decided that we shall stay here.
Charges!  Come on, come on!
Oh, my! They'll be captured! Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me.
All right, move it! I said move it! Go on!
Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me?
Let's go!
Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea?
Freeze! Don't move!
We surrender. Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo.
Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away.
Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!
Come on! Come on!
Oh, Artoo, hurry! My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
I think I got it. I got it!
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
Freeze!
Oh, dear.
Lando...
(misinterpreting Han's reference) They did it!
Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us out of here and you pull both of these.
Excuse me, sir.
Put them back together right now.
Might I have a word with you, please?
What do you want?
Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator.
I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.
Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is.
I don't know where he is.
Nobody knows where he is.
What do you mean, "nobody knows"?
Well, uh, you see...
Deck Officer. Deck Officer!
Excuse me, sir. Might I inqu-...
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on?
Why not?
Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, lets find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger.
Sir, all the patrols are in. There's still no contact from Skywalker or Solo.
Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope.
Yes, sir.
Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventy-five...to one. Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes...from time to time. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll be all right. He's quite clever, you know...for a human being.
Take it easy.
Excuse us, please.
No. Wait -- there's something very weak coming through.
Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code.
No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. right?
Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand? And...do take care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear.
Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm going to get you to your ship.
Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our only hope.
K-one-zero...all troops disengage.
Oh! Wait for me!
Transport, this is Solo. Better take off -- I can't get to you. I'll get the princess out on the Falcon.
But...but...but...where are you going? Uh...come back!!
Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a permanent resident!
Wait! Wait!
It might.
Captain Solo, Captain Solo...sir, might I suggest that you... It can wait.
Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us.
Sir, sir! Might I suggest...
Prepare to make the jump to light-speed.
But, sir!
I think we're in trouble.
If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed!
You don't have to do this to impress me.
Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one.
I'm not going to argue with that.
Pulverized?
Closer?
Closer?!
Yeah. That'll do nicely.
Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going?
I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but...does that include shutting me down, too?
No, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.
Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable.
Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these things.  Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive.
Oh! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most...
No, you're not. You're...
Sir, sir! I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.
Outside, in the cave.
There it is. Listen! Listen!
Then I'm going with you.
I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. (hears another mysterious noise) Oh, no.
Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more.
Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly thing. Shoo! Shoo!
Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off!
Look!
I see it, I see it.
We're doomed!
It's not my fault.
Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
You're going to attack them?!
Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial Star Destroyer...
The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw.
I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough...
You will not deviate from your present course.
Rather touchy, aren't they?
Well, what would you like?
Well, they did let us land.
All right, all right, you old smoothie.
Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My facilities are at your... Well, really!
Yeah, I'm responsible these days. It's the price you pay for being successful.
Oh! Nice to see a familiar face.
E chu ta!
How rude!
Who are you?
Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I...I didn't mean to intrude. No, no, please don't get up. No!
The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in!
Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...!
Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop!
Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die.
I know.
What...what's going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see. Oh...they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected -- if he survives the freezing process, that is.
We're getting out of here.
I knew all along it had to be a mistake.
I had no choice...
What are you doing? Trust him, trust him!
What?
It sounds like Han.
Chewie.
I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all, he's only a Wookiee.
The security codes has been changed!
Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security system.
Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has takes control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive. This way.
Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal.
