certainly
i missed you padme i are missed you so
ilet us back ilet us all right it feels like we are been apart for a lifetime and it might have been   if the chancellor hadcan not been kidnapped i docan not think they would have ever brought us back from the outer rim sieges
yes here ilet us tired of all this deception i docan not care if they know we am married
i are given my life to the jedi order but i is only give up my life for you
are you all right you am trembling what will going on
that will not it i sense more   what is it
you am frightened  tell me what will going on
  is there someone else
ilet us afraid of losing you padme   that will all
it will just that i are never seen you like this  
that will   that will wonderful
  every second i was thinking of you protecting the endless nameless outer rim settlements became a torture   the battles were easy the longing became unbearable   i are never been so happy as i am at this moment
you are so beautiful
no it will because ilet us so in love with you
well that will not exactly what i meant  
i havecan not laughed in so long  
nothing   i remember when i gave this to you
it was a dream
like the ones i used to have about my mother just before she died
it was about you
it was only a dream you die in childbirth  
i docan not know
  i will not let this one become real padme
i know бн
have you told him anything
he will been a father to me but he will still on the council docan not tell him anything
the decree was posted this morning
it has become increasingly clear to many of us that the chancellor has become an enemy of democracy
we  had sit around debating any longer we have decided to do what we can to stop it senator mon mothma and i are putting together an organization  
that means those closest to you   even family   no one can be told
rest well my lady
is there anything i might do for you my lady
beautiful iscan not it
how are you feeling
he why do you think it will a boy
whoa with a kick that strong it will got to be a girl
i may be on the council but   they refused to accept me as a jedi master
they still treat me as if i were a padawan learner  they fear my power that will the problem
sometimes i wonder what will happening to the jedi order   i think this war is destroying the principles of the republic
what do you mean
i docan not believe that and you am sounding like a separatist
docan not ask me to do that padme make a motion in the senate where that kind of a request belongs ilet us not your errand boy ilet us not anyone will errand boy
nothing
you  had help me   ilet us trying to help you i sense   there are things you are not telling me
has anakin been to see you
i know   he deserves it he is impatient strong willed very opinionated but truly gifted
you should be a jedi padme
it will anakin   he will becoming moody and detached he will been put in a difficult position as the chancellor will representative   but i think it will more than that i was hoping he may have talked to you
neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either
i know how he feels about you
nothing he didcan not have to
i know you both too well i can see you two are in love padme ilet us worried about him i fear your relationship has confused him he will changed considerably since we returned   padme ilet us not telling the council about any of this i   i hope i didcan not upset you we am all friends i care about both of you  
we are hoping to form an alliance in the senate to stop the chancellor from further subverting the constitution that will all
we docan not know where the jedi stand in all this
going against the chancellor without the support of the jedi is risky
save your energy
i sense someone familiar   obiwan will been here hascan not he
what did he want
you told him about us didcan not you
and he will not
ilet us not moody  
i docan not know   i feel   lost
obiwan and the council docan not trust me
something will happening   ilet us not the jedi i should be i am one of the most powerful jedi but ilet us not satisfied   i want more and i know i shouldcan not
i have found a way to save you
from my nightmares
i will not lose you padme
no i promise you i am becoming so powerful with my new knowledge of the force i will be able to keep you from dying
i understand your reservations completely senator and i assure you the appointment of governors will in no way compete with the duties of the senate
i want this terrible conflict to end as much as you do my lady and when it does i guarantee an immediate return to democracy  
i have said i will do what is right that should be enough for your   committee
you do know docan not you if the jedi destroy me any chance of saving her will be lost
hush not so loud
ilet us fine ilet us fine i came to see if you and the baby are safe
the situation is not good the jedi have tried to overthrow the republic  
something important is going on i heard a rumor they are going to banish all droids shhhhhh   not so loud whatever it is we have be the last to know
i will not betray the republic   my loyalties lie with the chancellor and with the senate   and with you
i docan not know   many jedi have been killed we can only hope that he will remained loyal to the chancellor
the republic is unstable padme the jedi arecan not the only ones trying to take advantage of the situation there are also traitors in the senate
you need to distance yourself from your friends in the senate the chancellor said they will be dealt with when this conflict is over
that will not happen i will not let it
have faith my love everything will soon be set right the chancellor has given me a very important mission the separatists have gathered in the mustafar system ilet us going there to end this war wait for me until i return   things will be different i promise please wait for me
well he is under a lot of stress artoo take care my little friend my lady is there anything i might do
a snack perhaps
i was held up what will happening
that will not true
the war is over  the separatists have been defeated  and the jedi rebellion has been foiled we stand on the threshold of a new beginning
in order to ensure our security and continuing stability the republic will be reorganized into the first galactic empire for a safe and secure society which i assure you will last for ten thousand years an empire that will continue to be ruled by this august body and a sovereign ruler chosen for life   an empire ruled by the majority   ruled by a new constitution  
we cannot let this happen
yes   right after the attack on the jedi temple
the republic has fallen padme   the jedi order is no more  
i believe we have been part of a plot hundreds of years in the making
no padme   it will over   the sith now rule the galaxy as they did before the republic
ilet us here looking for anakin   when was the last time you saw him
and do you know where he is now
padme i need your help he will in grave danger
from himself   padme anakin has turned to the dark side
i have seen a security hologram of him killing younglings
he was deceived by a lie we all were it appears that the chancellor is behind everything including the war palpatine is the sith lord we are been looking for after the death of count dooku anakin became his new apprentice
padme i must find him
he has become a very great threat
my lady let me come with you
as you wish my lady   but i strongly disagree
padme i saw your ship  
it will all right you am safe now what are you doing out here
what things
obiwan is trying to turn you against me
us
is obiwan going to protect you he  had   he  had help you he will not strong enough
love will not save you padme only my new powers can do that
i will not lose you the way i lost my mother i are become more powerful than any jedi has ever dreamed of and i are done it for you to protect you
docan not you see we docan not have to run away anymore i have brought peace to the republic i am more powerful than the chancellor i can overthrow him and together you and i can rule the galaxy make things the way we want them to be
i docan not want to hear any more about obiwan the jedi turned against me docan not you turn against me
because of obiwan
liar
you am with him you are betrayed me you brought him here to kill me
it will a boy
  and a girl
you have twins padme they need you   hang on
save your energy
it is with great surprise and joy the chair recognises the senator from naboo padme amidala
with you the force is strong  young senator to see you alive brings warm feeling to my heart
our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners on the moons of naboo
count dooku has always avoided any kind of conflict it appears he has no desire to start a war why would he kill you to what end
do you think that is a wise use of manpower during these stressful times
  situation is that serious  no but i do senator
you must remember him m lady  he watched over you during the blockade conflict
it will a great pleasure to see you again m lady
ilet us sure the jedi council have their reasons
so have you  grown more beautiful i mean  and much shorter  for a senator i mean
i am very grateful you are here master kenobi the situation is more dangerous than the senator will admit
we will do as the council has instructed and you will learn your place young one
yousa betchen mesa bottums
oh pardoneay senator i mean i am honoured to accept this heavy burden i take on this responsibility with deep humility tinged with an overwhelming pride it is not every day that i am called upon to 
of course m lady
docan not worry now that the council has ordered an investigation it will not take master obiwan long to find that bounty hunter
sometimes we have to let go of our pride and do what is requested of us
sorry m lady i was only trying to 
please docan not call me that
annie 
it will anakin when you say annie it will like ilet us still a little boy  and ilet us not
master obiwan manages not to see it 
docan not get me wrong  obiwan is a great mentor as wise as master yoda and as powerful as master windu i am truly thankful to be his apprentice only  although ilet us a padawan learner in some ways  a lot of ways  ilet us ahead of him ilet us ready for the trials i know i am he knows it too he believes ilet us too unpredictable  other jedi my age have gone through the trials and made it  i know i started my training late  but he will not let me move on
it will worse  he will overly critical he never listens he just doescan not understand it will not fair
ilet us not whining ilet us not
i know 
i am grown up you said it yourself
why not
ahh  so you have jedi powers too
be safe m lady
he have be safe with me
it will not me m lady i worry about you what if they realise ilet us not you
i will get to the bottom of this plot quickly m lady you have be back here in no time
time to go
may the force be with you master
ilet us kinda scared too this is my first assignment on my own
no no mom no  what
thank you
i look forward to seeing naboo again i are thought about it every day since i left it will by far the most beautiful place i are ever seen 
i think time has given me much more mature feelings to enhance my perception
or be with the people i love
attachment is forbidden possession is forbidden compassion which i would define as unconditional love is central to a jedi will life so you might say we am encouraged to love
you havecan not changed a bit you am exactly the way i remember you in my dreams i doubt if naboo has changed much either
i  had wait to breathe the sweet breeze that comes off the rolling hills whenever i try to visualise the force those hills are what i see i love naboo
if i grew up here i docan not think i is ever leave
no really when i started my training i was very homesick and very lonely this city and my mom were the only pleasant things i had to think about  the problem was the more i thought about my mom the worse i felt but i would feel better if i thought about the palace  the way it shimmers in the sunlight  the way the air always smells of flowers 
well tell me did you dream of power and politics when you were a little girl
the people you served thought you did a good job i heard they tried to amend the constitution so you could stay in office
i agree i think the republic needs you  ilet us glad you chose to serve i feel things are going to happen in our generation that will change the galaxy in profound ways
we are been worried about you ilet us so glad you am safe padme
how many systems have joined count dooku and the separatists
do you see any way through negotiations to bring the separatists back into the republic
the armies of commerce why has nothing been done in the senate to restrain them
remember counsellor the courts were able to reduce the federation will armies that will a move in the right direction
we must keep our faith in the republic the day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it
what is your suggestion master jedi
hey hold on a minute
excuse me i am in charge of security here m lady
aunt padme aunt padme
they am eating over at jev narran will later mom they just had a snack they have be fine
a little
well this is exciting do you know anakin you am the first boyfriend my sister will ever brought home
a bodyguard oh padme they didcan not tell us it was that serious
honey when are you going to settle down havecan not you had enough of that life i certainly have
 yes  ilet us afraid she is
why havecan not you told us about him
a boy have you seen the way he looks at you
it will obvious he has feelings for you are you saying little baby sister that you havecan not noticed
well maybe you havecan not noticed the way he looks at you i think you am afraid to
sola will just concerned  we all are
i just want to get there before dark you still live at home
i never had a real home home was always where my mom was is this you
i do too i guess it comes from growing up on a desert planet
i docan not like sand it will coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere not like here here everything will soft  and smooth 
everything here is magical
sometimes when you believe something to be real it becomes real real enough anyway 
i think it will true 
ilet us sorry when ilet us around you my mind is no longer my own
what
may i tell you something
then how can i tell you
it doescan not work around you my mind is always a muddle  i can only think of you
from the moment i met you all those years ago a day hascan not gone by when i havecan not thought of you and now that ilet us close to you again ilet us in agony the closer i get to you the worse it gets the thought of not being with you mskes my stomach turn over  my mouth goes dry i feel dizzy i  had breathe ilet us haunted by the kiss you should never have given me my heart is beating hoping that kiss will not become a scar you are in my very soul tormenting me what can i do i will do anything you ask  if you are suffering as much as i am tell me
anything will possible padme please listen 
then you do feel something there will an extraordinary connection between us you  had deny that
i was destined to be a jedi i docan not think i could be anything else but you are asking me to be rational that is something i know i cannot do i wish i could wish my feelings away  but i  had
it wouldcan not have to be that way  we could keep it a secret
sure you do  you just docan not want to tell me
they only work on the weakminded you are anything but weakminded
all right i get the picture  whatever happened to him
maybe he was the smart one
i like two or three but ilet us not really sure about one of them i docan not think the system works
we need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problems agree what will in the best interests of all the people and then do it
then they should be made to
i docan not know someone
of course not me
someone wise
well if it works 
on no i is be much too frightened to tease a senator
your presence is soothing
jedi docan not have nightmares
i saw my mother i saw her as clearly as i see you now she will suffering padme she is in pain they am killing her i know ilet us disobeying my mandate to protect you senator i know i will be punished and possibly thrown out of the jedi order but i must go i have to help her ilet us sorry padme i docan not have a choice
what about master obiwan
oh my  oh my master anakin my goodness i can hardly believe it and this must be miss padme
oh dear ilet us so terribly sorry master annie
hello
to find my mother
take my speeder bike
please docan not leave us miss padme these people need your help
that will something i cannot relate to as a protocol droid ilet us either active or inactive there will no inbetween
do you really think so i suppose i shouldcan not expect 
oh ilet us not unhappy  and my masters here ar so kind i wouldcan not wish to trouuble them it will just  being like this  well it will embarrassing
naked if you pardon the expression you see when master annie made me he never quite found the time to give me any outer covering it will so humiliating how would you like it if you had to go around with all your circuits showing
of course you wouldcan not nobody would it will simply not protocol
i docan not think so only master annie 
oh how observant of you miss padme of course ilet us just not mechanically minded  if you see what i mean
ooooh that will tickles
ilet us going after him
understood master
if he will still alive
 he will like my father but you heard master windu he gave me strict orders to stay here
hey where are you going
no you am not
ilet us not letting you go out there it will too dangerous
it will my job to protect you i said it will too dangerous you am not going and that will final
senator amidala i are heard so much about you
ilet us delighted to meet you at last we have a great deal to discuss senator i hope you can keep your young jedi under control
he has been convicted of espionage senator and will be executed in just a few hours i believe
we docan not recognise the republic here senator but if naboo were to join our alliance i could easily hear your plea for clemency
i docan not wish to make you to join our cause against your will senator but you are a rational honest representative of your people and i assume you want to do what will in their best interest arecan not you fed up with the corruption the bureaucrats the hypocrisy of it all arecan not you be honest senator
you believe in the same ideals we believe in the same ideals we are striving to make prominent
the chancellor means well m lady but he is incompetent he has promised to cut the bureaucracy but the bureaucrats are stronger than ever no senator the republic cannot be fixed it is time to start over the democratic process in the republic is a sham a shell game played on the voters it will not be long before the cult of greed called the republic will lose even the pretext of democracy and freedom
are you willing to betray your jedi friends without your cooperation i can do nothing to stop their execution
you may cause a lot of bloodshed my young jedi but you will not escape
do you have anything to say before your sentence is carried out
docan not be afraid
what are you talking about
you love me i thought we decided not to fall in love that we would be forced to live a lie that it would destroy our lives 
you okay
then ilet us sorry old friend you will have to be destroyed
 not yet
