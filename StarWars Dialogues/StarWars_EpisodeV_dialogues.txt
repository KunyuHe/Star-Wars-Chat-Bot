LUKE	Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you read me?
HAN	Loud and clear, kid. What's up?
LUKE	Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings.
HAN	There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. The sensors are placed. I'm going back.
LUKE	Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long.
LUKE	Hey, steady girl. What's the matter? You smell something?
LUKE	Aaargh!
HAN	Chewie!
HAN	All right, don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give you a hand.
RIEEKAN	Solo?
HAN	No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place. You'll know if anything comes around.
RIEEKAN	Commander Skywalker reported in yet?
HAN	No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.
RIEEKAN	With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
HAN	General, I've got to leave. I can't stay anymore.
RIEEKAN	I'm sorry to hear that.
HAN	Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut, I'm a dead man.
RIEEKAN	A death mark's not an easy thing to live with. You're a good fighter, Solo. I hate to lose you.
HAN	Thank you, General.
HAN	Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it.
LEIA	That's right.
HAN	Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess.
LEIA	Han!
HAN	Yes, Your Highnessness?
LEIA	I thought you decided to stay.
HAN	Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind. 
LEIA	Han, we need you!
HAN	We?
LEIA	Yes.
HAN	Oh, what about you need?
LEIA	I need? I don't know what you're talking about.
HAN	You probably don't.
LEIA	And what precisely am I supposed to know?
HAN	Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
LEIA	Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader...
HAN	No! That's not it. Come on. Aahhh -- uh huh! Come on.
LEIA	You're imagining things.
HAN	Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?
LEIA	I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.
HAN	I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!
C-3PO	Don't try to blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess's chamber. But it's supposed to be freezing. How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don't know.
C-3PO	Oh, switch off.
HAN	Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us out of here and you pull both of these.
C-3PO	Excuse me, sir.
HAN	Put them back together right now.
C-3PO	Might I have a word with you, please?
HAN	What do you want?
C-3PO	Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator.
HAN	I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.
C-3PO	Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is.
HAN	I don't know where he is.
C-3PO	Nobody knows where he is.
HAN	What do you mean, "nobody knows"?
C-3PO	Well, uh, you see...
HAN	Deck Officer. Deck Officer!
C-3PO	Excuse me, sir. Might I inqu-...
DECK OFFICER	Yes, sir?
HAN	Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?
DECK OFFICER	I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in through the south entrance.
HAN	It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out there.
DECK OFFICER	Yes, sir.
C-3PO	Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on?
HAN	Why not?
C-3PO	Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, lets find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger.
DECK OFFICER	Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't come in through the south entrance. He might have forgotten to check in.
HAN	Not likely. Are the speeders ready?
DECK OFFICER	Not yet. We're having some trouble adapting them to the cold.
HAN	Then we'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
DECK OFFICER	Sir, the temperature's dropping too rapidly.
HAN	That's right. And my friends out in it.
ASSISTANT OFFICER	I'll cover sector twelve. Have com-control set screen alpha.
DECK OFFICER	Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you reach the first marker.
HAN	Then I'll see you in hell!
C-3PO	You must come along now, Artoo. There's really nothing more we can do. And my joints are freezing up.
C-3PO	Don't say thing like that! Of course we'll see Master Luke again. He'll be quite all right, you'll see. (to himself) Stupid little short-circuit. He'll be quite all right.
LIEUTENANT	Sir, all the patrols are in. There's still no contact from Skywalker or Solo.
C-3PO	Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope.
DERLIN	Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight. The shield doors must be closed.
DERLIN	Close the doors.
LIEUTENANT	Yes, sir.
C-3PO	Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventy-five...to one.
C-3PO	Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes...from time to time. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll be all right. He's quite clever, you know...for a human being.
OBI-WAN	Luke...Luke.
LUKE	Ben?
OBI-WAN	You will go to the Dagobah system.
LUKE	Dagobah system?
OBI-WAN	There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me.
LUKE	Ben...Ben.
HAN	Luke! Luke! Don't do this, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here.
HAN	Not much time.
LUKE	Ben...Ben...
HAN	Hang on, kid.
LUKE	Dagobah system...
HAN	Whew...
LUKE	Dagobah...
HAN	This may smell bad, kid...
LUKE	Yoda...
HAN	...but it will keep you warm...til I get the shelter built. (struggling to get Luke in the carcass) Ooh...I thought they smelled bad on the outside!
ZEV	Echo Base...I've got something! Not much, but it could be a life form.
ZEV	This is Rouge Two. this is Rouge Two. Captain Solo, so you copy? Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rouge Two.
HAN	Good morning. Nice of you guys to drop by.
ZEV	Echo Base...this is Rouge Two. I found them. Repeat, I found them.
C-3PO	Master Luke, sir, it's good to see you fully functional again.
C-3PO	Artoo expresses his relief, also.
HAN	How are you feeling, kid? You don't look so bad to me. In fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark.
LUKE	Thanks to you.
HAN	That's two you owe me, junior.
HAN	Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer.
LEIA	I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield.
HAN	That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.
LEIA	I don't know where you get you delusions, laser brain.
HAN	Laugh it up, fuzz ball. But you didn't see us alone in the south passage.
HAN	She expressed her true feelings for me.
LEIA	My...! Why, you stuck up,...half-witted,...scruffy-looking... nerf-herder!
HAN	Who's scruffy-looking?  I must have hit her pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?
LEIA	Why, I guess you don't know everything about women yet?
ANNOUNCER	Headquarters personnel, report to command center.
HAN	Take it easy.
C-3PO	Excuse us, please.
RIEEKAN	Princess...we have a visitor.
RIEEKAN	We've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve, moving east.
SENIOR CONTROLLER	It's metal.
LEIA	Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke.
HAN	It could be a speeder, one of ours.
SENIOR CONTROLLER	No. Wait -- there's something very weak coming through.
C-3PO	Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code.
HAN	It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let's check it out.
RIEEKAN	Send Rouges Ten and Eleven to station three-eight.
HAN	Afraid there's not much left.
LEIA	What was it?
HAN	Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct.
LEIA	An Imperial probe droid.
HAN	It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here.
RIEEKAN	We'd better start the evacuation.
PIETT	Admiral.
OZZEL	Yes, Captain
PIETT	I think we've got something, sir. The report is only a fragment had.
OZZEL	We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy. I want proof, not leads!
PIETT	The visuals indicate life readings.
OZZEL	It could mean anything. If we followed every lead...
PIETT	But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human forms.
VADER	You found something?
PIETT	Yes, my lord.
VADER	That's it. The Rebels are there.
OZZEL	My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements. It could be smugglers, it could be...
VADER	That is the system. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them. Set your course for the Hoth system. General Veers, prepare you men.
REBEL CAPTAIN	Groups seven and ten will stay behind to fly the speeders. As soon as each transport is loaded, evacuation control will give clearance for immediate launch.
REBEL FIGHTER	Right, sir.
HAN	Okay, that's it. Try it...Off! Turn it off! Turn it off! Off!
MEDICAL DROID	Sir, it will take quite awhile to evacuate the T-forty- sevens.
LUKE	Well, forget the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports.
MEDICAL DROID	Take care, sir.
LUKE	Thanks.
LUKE	Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?
HAN	Hi, kid.  There's got to be a reason for it. Check it at the other end. Wait a second. (to Luke) You all right?
LUKE	Yeah.
HAN	Be careful.
LUKE	You, too.
CONTROLLER	General, there's a fleet of Star Destroyers coming out of hyperspace in sector four.
RIEEKAN	Reroute all power to the energy shield. We've got to hold them till all transports are away. Prepare for ground assault.
VADER	What is it, General?
VEERS	My lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed. Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment.
VADER	The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system.
VEERS	He felt surprise was wiser...
VADER	He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops for a surface attack.
VEERS	Yes, my lord.
OZZEL	Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of light-speed, and we're preparing to...Aaagh!
VADER	You have failed me for the last time, Admiral. Captain Piett.
PIETT	Yes, my lord.
VADER	Make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system. You are in command now, Admiral Piett.
PIETT	Thank you, Lord Vader.
LEIA	All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance. The heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded. Only two fighter escorts per ship. The energy shield can only be opened for a short time, so you'll have to stay very close to your transports.
HOBBIE	Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?
LEIA	The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path. When you've gotten past the energy shield, proceed directly to the rendezvous point. Understood?
PILOTS	Right. Okay.
LEIA	Good luck.
DERLIN	Okay. Everyone to your stations. Let's go!
RIEEKAN	Their primary target will be the power generators. Prepare to open the shield.
CONTROLLER	Sir, Rebel ships are coming into our sector.
CAPTAIN	Good. Our first catch of the day.
WOMAN CONTROLLER	Stand by, ion control....Fire!
ANNOUNCER	The first transport is away.
DACK	Feeling all right, sir?
LUKE	Just like new, Dack. How about you?
DACK	Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself.
LUKE	I know what you mean.
TRENCH OFFICER	Echo Station Three-T-Eight.
TRENCH OFFICER	We have spotted Imperial walkers!
CONTROLLER	Imperial walkers on the north ridge.
LUKE	Echo station Five-Seven. We're on our way.
LUKE	All right, boys, keep tight now.
DACK	Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set.
LUKE	Steady, Dack. Attack pattern delta. Go now!
LUKE	All right, I'm coming in.
LUKE	Hobbie, you still with me?
LUKE	That armor's too strong for blasters.
LUKE	Rouge Group, use your harpoons and tow cables. Go for the legs. It might be our only chance of stopping them. (to Dack) All right, stand by, Dack.
DACK	Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control. I'll have to cut in the auxiliary.
LUKE	Just hang on. Hang on, Dack. Get ready to fire that tow cable.
LUKE	Dack? Dack!
VEERS	Yes, Lord Vader. I've reached the main power generator. The shield will be down in moments. You may start your landing.
LUKE	Rouge Three.
WEDGE	Copy, Rouge Leader
LUKE	Wedge, I've lost my gunner. You'll have to make this shot. I'll cover for you. Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass.
WEDGE	Coming around, Rouge Leader.
LUKE	Steady, Rouge Two
WEDGE	Activate harpoon.
WEDGE	Good shot, Janson.
WEDGE	One more pass.
JANSON	Coming around. Once more.
JANSON	One more.
JANSON	Cable out! Let her go!
WEDGE	Detach cable.
JANSON	Cable detached.
TRENCH OFFICER	Come on!
WEDGE	Whooha!! That got him!
LUKE	I see it, Wedge. Good work.
RIEEKAN	I don't think we can protect two transports at a time.
LEIA	It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no choice.
RIEEKAN	Launch patrols.
LEIA	Evacuate remaining ground staff.
HAN	No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. right?
C-3PO	Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand? And...do take care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear.
VEERS	All troops will debark for ground assault. Prepare to target the main generator.
LUKE	Rouge Two, are you all right?
ZEV	Yeah. I'm with you, Rouge Leader.
LUKE	We'll set harpoon. I'll cover for you.
ZEV	Coming around.
LUKE	Watch that cross fire, boys.
ZEV	Set for position three.  Steady.
LUKE	Stay tight and low.
LUKE	Hobbie, I've been hit!
HAN	You all right?
LEIA	Why are you still here?
HAN	I heard the command center had been hit.
LEIA	You got your clearance to leave.
HAN	Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm going to get you to your ship.
C-3PO	Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our only hope.
LEIA	Send all troops in sector twelve to the south slope to protect the fighters.
ANNOUNCER	Imperial troops have entered the base.
HAN	Come on...that's it.
LEIA	Give the evacuation code signal. And get to your transports!
HEAD CONTROLLER	K-one-zero...all troops disengage.
C-3PO	Oh! Wait for me!
OFFICER	Begin retreat!
SECOND OFFICER	Fall back!
VEERS	Distance to power generators?
PILOT	One-seven, decimal two-eight.
VEERS	Target. Maximum fire power.
HAN	Transport, this is Solo. Better take off -- I can't get to you. I'll get the princess out on the Falcon.
C-3PO	But...but...but...where are you going? Uh...come back!!
the blocked passageway, Darth Vader strides behind them.
C-3PO	Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop!
C-3PO	How typical.
HAN	Come on.
HAN	Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a permanent resident!
C-3PO	Wait! Wait!
HAN	How's this?
LEIA	Would it helped if I got out and pushed?
HAN	It might.
C-3PO	Captain Solo, Captain Solo...sir, might I suggest that you...
C-3PO	It can wait.
LEIA	The bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
HAN	This baby's got a few surprises left in her, sweetheart.
HAN	Come on! Come on! Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a burnout.
HAN	See?
LEIA	Someday you're going to be wrong, and I hope I'm there to see it.
HAN	Punch it!
LUKE	Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff.
WEDGE	Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous.
LUKE	Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going.
LUKE	There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course.
LUKE	We're not going to regroup with the others.
LUKE	We're going to the Dagobah system.
LUKE	Yes, Artoo?
LUKE	That's all right. I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while.
HAN	I saw them! I saw them!
LEIA	Saw what?
HAN	Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us.
C-3PO	Sir, sir! Might I suggest...
HAN	Shut him up or shut him down!  Check the deflector shield!
HAN	Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them.
IMPERIAL OFFICER	Take evasive action!
HAN	Prepare to make the jump to light-speed.
C-3PO	But, sir!
LEIA	They're getting closer!
HAN	Oh yeah? Watch this.
LEIA	Watch what?
HAN	I think we're in trouble.
C-3PO	If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed!
HAN	We're in trouble!
HAN	Horizontal boosters...!
HAN	Alluvial dampers...! Well that's not it.
HAN	Bring me the hydrospanners!
HAN	I don't know how we're going to get out of this one.
HAN	Oww! Chewie!
HAN	That was no laser blast! Something hit us.
LEIA	Han, get up here!
HAN	Come on, Chewie!
LEIA	Asteroids!
HAN	Oh, no! Chewie, set two-seven-one.
LEIA	What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid field?
HAN	They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?
LEIA	You don't have to do this to impress me.
C-3PO	Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one.
HAN	Never tell me the odds!
HAN	You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be it, sweetheart.
LEIA	I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
HAN	I'm not going to argue with that.
C-3PO	Pulverized?
HAN	I'm going in closer to one of the big ones.
LEIA	Closer?
C-3PO	Closer?!
C-3PO	Oh, this is suicide!
HAN	There. That looks pretty good.
LEIA	What looks pretty good?
HAN	Yeah. That'll do nicely.
C-3PO	Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going?
LEIA	I hope you know what you're doing.
HAN	Yeah, me too.
LUKE	Yes, that's it. Dagobah.
LUKE	No, I'm not going to change my mind about this. (getting a little nervous) I'm not picking up any cities or technology. Massive life-form readings, though. There's something alive down there...
LUKE	Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids.
LUKE	I know, I know! All the scopes are dead. I can't see a thing! Just hang on, I'm going to start the landing cycle...
LUKE	No, Artoo, you stay put. I'll have a look around.
LUKE	Artoo?
LUKE	Artoo! Where are you?
LUKE	Artoo! You be more careful.
LUKE	Artoo -- that way!
LUKE	Artoo!
LUKE	Oh, no! Are you all right? Come on. You're lucky you don't taste very good. Anything broken?
LUKE	If you're saying coming here was a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree with you. Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here? It's like... something out of a dream, or, I don't know. Maybe I'm just going crazy.
VADER	Yes, Admiral?
PIETT	Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, lord. But...it has entered an asteroid field and we cannot risk...
VADER	Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral. I want that ship and not excuses.
PIETT	Yes, lord.
HAN	I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems. 
C-3PO	Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but...does that include shutting me down, too?
HAN	No, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.
C-3PO	Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable.
HAN	Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these things.  Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive.
C-3PO	Oh! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most...
LEIA	Let go.
HAN	Sshh!
LEIA	Let go, please.
HAN	Don't get excited.
LEIA	Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited.
HAN	Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else.
LUKE	Ready for some power? Okay. Let's see now. Put that in there. There you go.
LUKE	Now all I have to do is find this Yoda...if he even exists.
LUKE	Still...there's something familiar about this place. I feel like...I don't know...
STRANGE VOICE	Feel like what?
LUKE	Like we're being watched!
CREATURE	Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm.
CREATURE	I am wondering, why are you here?
LUKE	I'm looking for someone.
CREATURE	Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm?
LUKE	Right.
CREATURE	Help you I can. Yes, mmmm.
LUKE	I don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior.
CREATURE	Ahhh! A great warrior.  Wars not make one great.
LUKE	Put that down. Hey! That's my dinner.
CREATURE	How you get so big, eating food of this kind?
LUKE	Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just...
CREATURE	Aww, cannot get your ship out?
LUKE	Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh...you're making a mess. Hey, give me that!
CREATURE	Mine! Or I will help you not.
LUKE	I don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole.
CREATURE	Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is.
CREATURE	Ah, ah, ah!
LUKE	Oh, Artoo, let him have it.
CREATURE	Mine! Mine!
LUKE	Artoo!
CREATURE	Mine!
CREATURE	Mine!
LUKE	Now will you move along, little fella? We're got a lot of work to do.
CREATURE	No! No, no! Stay and help you, I will.  Find your friend, hmm?
LUKE	I'm not looking for a friend, I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
CREATURE	Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda.
LUKE	You know him?
CREATURE	Mmm. Take you to him, I will.  Yes, yes. But now, we must eat. Come. Good food. Come.
CREATURE	Come, come.
LUKE	Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo.
C-3PO	Oh, where is Artoo when I need him?
C-3PO	Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.
HAN	Well, of course I'll have to replace it.
HAN	Here! And Chewie...
HAN	...I think we'd better replace the negative power coupling.
HAN	Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help.
LEIA	Would you please stop calling me that?
HAN	Sure, Leia.
LEIA	Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes.
HAN	I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though. (he watches her reaction) Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right.
LEIA	Occasionally  maybe...when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
HAN	Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that.
LEIA	Stop that.
HAN	Stop what?
LEIA	Stop that! My hands are dirty.
HAN	My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of?
LEIA	Afraid?
HAN	You're trembling.
LEIA	I'm not trembling.
HAN	You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life.
LEIA	I happen to like nice men.
HAN	I'm a nice man.
LEIA	No, you're not. You're...
C-3PO	Sir, sir! I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling.
HAN	Thank you. Thank you very much.
C-3PO	Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.
NEEDA	...and that, Lord Vader, was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes. Considering the amount of damage we've sustained, they must have been destroyed.
VADER	No, Captain, they're alive. I want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found.
PIETT	Lord Vader.
VADER	Yes, Admiral, what is it?
PIETT	The Emperor commands you make contact with him.
VADER	Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a clear transmission.
PIETT	Yes, my lord.
VADER	What is thy bidding, my master?
DARTH SIDIOUS	There is a great disturbance in the Force.
VADER	I have felt it.
DARTH SIDIOUS	We have a new enemy -- Luke Skywalker.
VADER	Yes, my master.
DARTH SIDIOUS	He could destroy us.
VADER	He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him.
DARTH SIDIOUS	The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi.
VADER	If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Yes. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done?
VADER	He will join us or die, my master.
LUKE	Look, I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we can't see Yoda now.
CREATURE	Patience! For the Jedi it is time to eat as well. Eat, eat. Hot. Good food, hm? Good, hmm?
LUKE	How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there?
CREATURE	Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him. (tasting food from the pot) Rootleaf, I cook. Why wish you become Jedi? Hm?
LUKE	Mostly because of my father, I guess.
CREATURE	Ah, your father. Powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi, mmm.
LUKE	Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am. (fed up) Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time.
CREATURE	I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience.
OBI-WAN	He will learn patience.
YODA	Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father.
OBI-WAN	Was I any different when you taught me?
YODA	Hah. He is not ready.
LUKE	Yoda! I am ready. I...Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm ready.
YODA	Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. (to the invisible Ben, indicating Luke) This one a long time have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. (turning to Luke) You are reckless!
OBI-WAN	So was I, if you'll remember.
YODA	He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training.
LUKE	But I've learned so much.
YODA	Will he finished what he begins?
LUKE	I won't fail you -- I'm not afraid.
YODA	Oh, you will be. You will be.
C-3PO	Sir, if I may venture an opinion...
HAN	I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio.
LEIA	There's something out there.
HAN	Where?
LEIA	Outside, in the cave.
C-3PO	There it is. Listen! Listen!
HAN	I'm going out there.
LEIA	Are you crazy?!
HAN	I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let something tear it apart.
LEIA	Then I'm going with you.
C-3PO	I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. (hears another mysterious noise) Oh, no.
LEIA	This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock at all.
HAN	There's an awful lot of moisture in here.
LEIA	I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this.
HAN	Yeah.
HAN	Watch out!
HAN	Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables.
LEIA	Mynocks?
HAN	Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more.
C-3PO	Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly thing. Shoo! Shoo!
HAN	Wait a minute...
HAN	All right, Chewie, let's get out of here!
LEIA	The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to...
HAN	No time to discuss this as a committee.
LEIA	I am not a committee!
LEIA	You can't make the jump to light-speed in this asteroid field...
HAN	Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off!
C-3PO	Look!
HAN	I see it, I see it.
C-3PO	We're doomed!
LEIA	The cave is collapsing.
HAN	This is no cave.
LEIA	What?
YODA	Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger...fear...aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.
LUKE	Vader. Is the dark side stronger?
YODA	No...no...no. Quicker, easier, more seductive.
LUKE	But how am I to know the good side from the bad?
YODA	You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.
LUKE	But tell me why I can't...
YODA	No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmm.
LUKE	There's something not right here.
LUKE	I feel cold, death.
YODA	That place...is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go.
LUKE	What's in there?
YODA	Only what you take with you.
YODA	Your weapons...you will not need them.
PIETT	Bounty hunters. We don't need that scum.
FIRST CONTROLLER	Yes, sir.
PIETT	Those Rebels won't escape us.
SECOND CONTROLLER	Sir, we have a priority signal from the Star Destroyer Avenger.
PIETT	Right.
galactic fortune hunters	There is Bossk, a slimy, tentacled VADER	...there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegrations.
BOBA FETT	As you wish.
PIETT	Lord Vader! My lord, we have them.
C-3PO	Oh, thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field.
HAN	Let's get out of here. Ready for light-speed? One...two...three!
HAN	It's not fair!
HAN	The transfer circuits are working. It's not my fault!
LEIA	No light-speed?
HAN	It's not my fault.
C-3PO	Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
HAN	Turn her around.
HAN	I said turn her around! I'm going to put all power in the front shield.
LEIA	You're going to attack them?!
C-3PO	Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial Star Destroyer...
LEIA	Shut up!
NEEDA	They're moving to attack position. Shields up!
NEEDA	Track them,. They may come around for another pass.
TRACKING OFFICER	Captain Needa, the ship no longer appears on our scopes.
NEEDA	They can't have disappeared. No ship that small has a cloaking device.
TRACKING OFFICER	Well, there's no trace of them, sir.
COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER	Captain, Lord Vader demands an update on the pursuit.
NEEDA	Get a shuttle ready. I shall assume full responsibility for losing them, and apologize to Lord Vader. Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.
COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER	Yes, Captain Needa.
YODA	Use the Force. Yes...
YODA	Now...the stone. Feel it.
YODA	Concentrate!
LUKE	Oh, no. We'll never get it out now.
YODA	So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say?
LUKE	Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally different.
YODA	No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned.
LUKE	All right, I'll give it a try.
YODA	No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.
LUKE	I can't. It's too big.
YODA	Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm? Mmmm.
YODA	And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It's energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we...(Yoda pinches Luke's shoulder)...not this crude matter. (a sweeping gesture) You must feel the Force around you. (gesturing) Here, between you...me...the tree...the rock...everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship!
LUKE	You want the impossible.
LUKE	I don't...I don't believe it.
YODA	That is why you fail.
VADER	Apology accepted, Captain Needa.
PIETT	Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing. If the Millennium Falcon went into light-speed, it'll be on the other side of the galaxy by now.
VADER	Alert all commands. Calculate every possible destination along their last know trajectory.
PIETT	Yes, my lord. We'll find them.
VADER	Don't fail me again, Admiral.
PIETT	Alert all commands. Deploy the fleet.
C-3PO	Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. (Chewie growls) No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me?
HAN	The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw.
C-3PO	I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough...
HAN	Thank you.
LEIA	What did you have in mind for your next move?
HAN	Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away.
LEIA	With the rest of the garbage. Then what?
HAN	Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any ideas?
LEIA	No. Where are we?
HAN	The Anoat system.
LEIA	Anoat system. There's not much there.
HAN	No. Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando.
LEIA	Lando system?
HAN	Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian. He's a card player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him.
LEIA	Thanks.
HAN	Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it.
LEIA	A mining colony?
HAN	Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me.
LEIA	Can you trust him?
HAN	No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that.
HAN	Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach!
LEIA	You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them.
YODA	Concentrate...feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm, yes. Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future...the past. Old friends long gone.
LUKE	Han! Leia!
YODA	Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control.
LUKE	I saw...I saw a city in the clouds.
YODA	Mmm. Friends you have there.
LUKE	They were in pain.
YODA	It is the future you see.
LUKE	Future? Will they die?
YODA	Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.
LUKE	I've got to go to them.
YODA	Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.
HAN	No, I don't have a landing permit. I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian.
HAN	Whoa! Wait a minute! Let me explain.
INTERCOM VOICE	You will not deviate from your present course.
C-3PO	Rather touchy, aren't they?
LEIA	I thought you knew this person.
HAN	Well, that was a long time ago. I'm sure he's forgotten about that.
INTERCOM VOICE	Permission granted to land on Platform Three-two-seven.
HAN	Thank you.
HAN	There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me.
LEIA	Who's worried?
C-3PO	Oh. No one to meet us.
LEIA	I don't like this.
HAN	Well, what would you like?
C-3PO	Well, they did let us land.
HAN	Look, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Trust me.
HAN	See? My friend.  Keep your eyes open, okay?
LANDO	Why, you slimy, double-crossing, no-good swindler! You've got a lot of guts coming here, after what you pulled.
LANDO	How you doing, you old pirate? So good to see you! I never thought I'd catch up with you again. Where you been?
C-3PO	Well, he seems very friendly.
LEIA	Yes...very friendly.
LANDO	What are you doing here?
HAN	Ahh...repairs. I thought you could help me out.
LANDO	What have you done to my ship?
HAN	Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square.
LANDO	Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm the administrator of this facility. and who might you be?
LEIA	Leia.
LANDO	Welcome, Leia.
HAN	All right, all right, you old smoothie.
C-3PO	Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My facilities are at your...
C-3PO	Well, really!
LANDO	What's wrong with the Falcon?
HAN	Hyperdrive.
LANDO	I'll get my people to work on it.
HAN	Good.
LANDO	You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times. She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.
HAN	How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you?
LANDO	Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties...(catches Han grinning at him) What's so funny?
HAN	You. Listen to you -- you sound like a businessman, a responsible leader. Who'd have thought that, huh?
LANDO	You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things.
HAN	Yeah.
LANDO	Yeah, I'm responsible these days. It's the price you pay for being successful.
C-3PO	Oh! Nice to see a familiar face.
SECOND THREEPIO	E chu ta!
C-3PO	How rude!
C-3PO	That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if...
C-3PO	Hello? How interesting. Oh, my.
MAN	Who are you?
C-3PO	Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I...I didn't mean to intrude. No, no, please don't get up. No!
YODA	Luke! You must complete the training.
LUKE	I can't keep the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I've got to help them.
YODA	You must not go!
LUKE	But Han and Leia will die if I don't.
OBI-WAN	You don't know that.
OBI-WAN	Even Yoda cannot see their fate.
LUKE	But I can help them! I feel the Force!
OBI-WAN	But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force.
YODA	Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure at the cave!
LUKE	But I've learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to return and finish what I've begun. You have my word.
OBI-WAN	It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. that is why your friends are made to suffer.
LUKE	And that is why I have to go.
OBI-WAN	Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost Vader.
LUKE	You won't.
YODA	Stopped they must be. On this depends. Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil.
OBI-WAN	Patience.
LUKE	And sacrifice Han and Leia?
YODA	If you honor what they fight for...yes!
OBI-WAN	If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot interfere.
LUKE	I understand.  Artoo, fire up the converters.
OBI-WAN	Luke, don't give in to hate -- that leads to the dark side.
YODA	Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.
LUKE	I will. And I'll return. I promise.
YODA	Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse.
OBI-WAN	That boy is our last hope.
YODA	No. There is another.
HAN	The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're in great shape.
LEIA	The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost.
HAN	Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out.
LEIA	I don't trust Lando.
HAN	Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides, we'll soon be gone.
LEIA	And then you're as good as gone, aren't you?
LEIA	What happened?
HAN	Where? Found him in a junk pile?
LEIA	Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
HAN	Lando's got people who can fix him.
LEIA	No, thanks.
LANDO	I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything?
LEIA	Not really.
LANDO	You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds.
LEIA	Thank you.
LANDO	Will you join me for a little refreshment?
LANDO	Everyone's invited, of course.
LANDO	Having trouble with you droid?
HAN	No. No problem. Why?
LANDO	So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into the...uh...jurisdiction of the Empire.
LEIA	So you're part of the mining guild then?
LANDO	No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be noticed...which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves.
HAN	Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down?
LANDO	That's always been a danger looming like a shadow over everything we've built here. But things have developed that will insure security. I've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever.
VADER	We would be honored if you would join us.
LANDO	I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. I'm sorry.
HAN	I'm sorry, too.
LUKE	No, Threepio's with them.
LUKE	Just hang on. We're almost there.
C-3PO	Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh -- Take this off! I, uh, don't mean to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no...Please don't get up. No!
C-3PO	Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the others. Oh, no! I've been shot!
LANDO	Lord Vader.
VADER	You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I have Skywalker.
BOBA FETT	He's no good to me dead.
VADER	He will not be permanently damaged.
LANDO	Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee?
VADER	They must never again leave this city.
LANDO	That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter!
VADER	Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
LANDO	No.
VADER	Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here.
LANDO	This deal's getting worse all the time.
C-3PO	Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not right because now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough...
HAN	I feel terrible.
LEIA	Why are they doing this?
HAN	They never even asked me any questions.
LEIA	Lando.
HAN	Get out of here, Lando!
LANDO	Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.
HAN	Over to you?
LANDO	They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
LEIA	What about Han?
LANDO Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter.
LEIA	Vader wants us all dead.
LANDO	He doesn't want you at all. He's after somebody called Skywalker.
HAN	Luke?
LANDO	Lord Vader has set a trap for him.
LEIA	And we're the bait.
LANDO	Well, he's on his way.
HAN	Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you? My friend!
LANDO	Stop! I've done all I can do. I'm sorry I couldn't do better, but I have my own problems.
HAN	Yeah, you're a real hero.
LEIA	You certainly have a way with people.
VADER	This facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor.
IMPERIAL SOLDIER	Lord Vader, ship approaching. X-wing class.
VADER	Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land.
LANDO	Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. If you put him in there, it might kill him.
VADER	I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged. We will test it...on Captain Solo.
C-3PO	If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish.
HAN	What's going on...buddy?
LANDO	You're being put into carbon freeze.
BOBA FETT	What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me.
VADER	The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in!
C-3PO	Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...!
HAN	Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop!
C-3PO	Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die.
HAN	Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey!
HAN	Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess -- you have to take care of her. You hear me?
LEIA	I love you!
HAN	I know.
C-3PO	What...what's going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see. Oh...they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected -- if he survives the freezing process, that is.
VADER	Well, Calrissian, did he survive?
LANDO	Yes, he's alive. And in perfect hibernation.
VADER	He's all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker.
IMPERIAL OFFICER	Skywalker has just landed, my lord.
VADER	Good. See to it that he finds his way here. Calrissian, take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship.
LANDO	You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision.
VADER	I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.
LEIA	Luke! Luke, don't -- it's a trap! It's a trap!
VADER	The Force is with you, young Skywalker. But you are not a Jedi yet.
LANDO	Well done. Hold them in the security tower -- and keep it quiet. Move.
LEIA	What do you think you're doing?
LANDO	We're getting out of here.
C-3PO	I knew all along it had to be a mistake.
LEIA	Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust you?
LANDO	I had no choice...
C-3PO	What are you doing? Trust him, trust him!
LEIA	Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice.
LANDO	I'm just trying to help...
LEIA	We don't need any of your help.
LANDO	H-a-a-a...
LEIA	What?
C-3PO	It sounds like Han.
LANDO	There's still a chance to save Han...I mean, at the East Platform...
LEIA	Chewie.
C-3PO	I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all, he's only a Wookiee.
BOBA FETT	Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold.
C-3PO	Artoo! Artoo! Where have you been?
C-3PO	Turn around, you wooly...!  Hurry, hurry! We're trying to save Han from the bounty hunter!
C-3PO	Well, at least your still in one piece! Look what happened to me!
C-3PO	Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!
VADER	You have learned much, young one.
LUKE	You'll find I'm full of surprises.
VADER	Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be true.
LUKE	No!
VADER	All to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor thought.
VADER	Impressive...most impressive.
VADER	Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear... now release your anger.
VADER	Only your hatred can destroy me.
LANDO	The security codes has been changed!
C-3PO	Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security system.
LANDO	Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has takes control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive.
LANDO	This way.
C-3PO	Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal.
C-3PO	What are you talking about? We're not interested in the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. It's fixed! Just open the door, you stupid lump.
C-3PO	I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful!
C-3PO	Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt, Bend down, you thoughtless...Ow!
LANDO	Leia! Go!
C-3PO	I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. Of course, I've looked better.
VADER	You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did.
VADER	There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.
LUKE	I'll never join you!
VADER	If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.
LUKE	He told me enough! He told me you killed him.
VADER	No. I am your father.
LUKE	No. No. That's not true! That's impossible!
VADER	Search your feelings. You know it to be true.
LUKE	No! No! No!
VADER	Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It's the only way.
LUKE	Ben...Ben, please!
LUKE	Ben. Leia!
LUKE	Hear me! Leia!
LEIA	Luke...We've got to go back.
LANDO	What?
LEIA	I know where Luke is.
LANDO	But what about those fighter?
LEIA	Chewie, just do it.
LANDO	But what about Vader?
LANDO	All right, all right, all right.
VADER	Bring my shuttle.
LANDO	Look, someone's up there.
LEIA	It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him. Lando, open the top hatch.
LEIA	Okay. Easy, Chewie.
LEIA	Lando?
LANDO	Okay, let's go.
LUKE	Oh, Leia.
LANDO	All right, Chewie. Let's go.
LEIA	I'll be back.
LEIA	Star Destroyer.
LANDO	All right, Chewie. Ready for light-speed.
LEIA	If your people fixed the hyperdrive.
LEIA	All the coordinates are set. It's now or never.
LANDO	Punch it!
LANDO	They told me they fixed it. I trusted them to fix it. It's not my fault!
PIETT	They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, lord.
VADER	Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon?
PIETT	Yes, my lord.
VADER	Good. Prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for stun.
PIETT	Yes, my lord.
C-3PO	Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light-speed?
C-3PO	We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated?
C-3PO	The city's central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo, you know better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing!
VADER	Luke.
LUKE	Father.
VADER	Son, come with me.
LUKE	Ben, why didn't you tell me?
LANDO	Chewie!
LUKE	It's Vader.
VADER	Luke...it is your destiny.
LUKE	Ben, why didn't you tell me?
PIETT	Alert all commands. Ready for the tractor beam.
C-3PO	Artoo, come back at once! You haven't finished with me yet! You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it. I'm standing here in pieces, and you're having delusions of grandeur!
C-3PO	Oh, you did it!
LANDO	Luke, we're ready for takeoff.
LUKE	Good luck, Lando
LANDO	When we find Jabba the Hut and that bounty hunter, we'll contact you.
LUKE	I'll meet you at the rendezvous point on Tatooine.
LANDO	Princess, we'll find Han. I promise.
LUKE	Chewie, I'll be waiting for your signal.
LUKE	Take care, you two. May the Force be with you.
LUKE	Ow!
