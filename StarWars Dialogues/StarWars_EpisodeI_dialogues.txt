SHMI	Annie! I'm not goiung to tell you again!
QUI-GON	Go on, you have a big day tomorrow.  Goodnight.
QUI-GON	Obi-Wan...
OBI-WAN	Yes, Master.
QUI-GON	Make an analysis of this blood sample I'm sending you.
OBI-WAN	Wait a minute...
QUI-GON	I need a midi-chlorian count.
OBI-WAN	All right. I've got it.
QUI-GON	What are your readings?
OBI-WAN	Something must be wrong with the transmission.
QUI-GON	Here's a signal check.
OBI-WAN	Strange. The transmission seems to be in good order, but the
QUI-GON	That's it then.
OBI-WAN	Even Master Yoda doesn't have a midi-chlorian count that high!
QUI-GON	No Jedi has.
OBI-WAN	What does it mean?
QUI-GON	I'm not sure.
PADME	I hope you're about finished.
ANAKIN	You were in my dream...you were leading a huge army into battle.
PADME	I hope not; I hate fighting. Your mother wants you to come in and
ANAKIN	Hook 'em up, Kitster.  I won't be long. Where's Qui-Gon?
PADME	He and Jar Jar left already. They're with Watto at the arena.
WATTO	...I want to see your spaceship the moment the race is over.

WATTO	Not if your ship belongs to me, I think...I warn you, no funny
QUI-GON	You don't think Anakin will win?
WATTO	Don't get me wrongo. I have great faith in the boy. He's a credit
QUI-GON	Why?
WATTO	He always wins.  I'm betting heavily on Sebulba.
QUI-GON	I'll take that bet.
WATTO	What??!! What do you mean?
QUI-GON	I'll wager my new racing pod against...say...the boy and his
WATTO	A Pod for slaves. I don't think so...well, poerhaps. Just one...the

QUI-GON	Both, or no bet.
WATTO	No Pod's worth two slaves...not by a long shot...one slave or
QUI-GON	The boy, then...

ANAKIN	No!
QUI-GON	Do you still think he cheated?

SHMI	Oh, my goodness, That's wonderful.
QUI-GON	And Anakin has been freed.
